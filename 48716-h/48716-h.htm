<h2 class="fs"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">The history of the 36th (Ulster) Division is
the record of a great effort and a great achievement.
The effort which resulted in its inception
was the outcome of the determination, on the part of
a people brought up in great traditions and inspired
with a fervent spirit of loyalty, that they should be
worthily represented in the fierce and prolonged
struggle which from the outset was clearly foreshadowed.
The achievement was the response
made to the call by their representatives, the gallant
deeds accomplished, the courage and determination
displayed, and the sacrifices made.</p>

<p>The narrative gives a very clear picture of what
the campaign in France and Flanders involved for
the troops engaged in it. There is no reference to
any great strategical movements or brilliant tactical
operations, because there were none such to describe.
It brings out, however, quite plainly that the victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
was gained in the only way in which it could have
been gained, by sheer hard fighting, carried out continuously,
now on a small, now on a large, scale,
but always by troops who never admitted defeat.</p>

<p>This was the character of the struggle into
which the Ulster Division was plunged from its
entrance into the campaign until its close, and the
book describes very fully the part it played in it.
Each chapter is a little history of itself, which frequently
has sufficient subject-matter for a volume,
and which always contains a record of events or
incidents of absorbing interest. It is not a narrative
of a series of unbroken successes, and there is no
pretence that all the efforts made by the Division
were successful. Readers of the History will find
stories of failures, but they were glorious failures,
the account of which no-one need feel ashamed to
describe or peruse.</p>

<p>A tribute, no more than is due, is paid to Major-General
Sir Oliver Nugent, K.C.B., D.S.O., the
General who was in command of the Division for
the greater part of the campaign, and who led it
throughout with a confidence in it only equalled by
its confidence in him. All who served under him
will always hold him in affectionate remembrance,
and all Ulstermen should realize that they owe him
a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope this History will be read, not only by
those who served in the Division and their relatives
and friends, but by all Irishmen.</p>

<p>Young men approaching manhood and young
women approaching womanhood should read it, and
ponder over the example their predecessors have set
them. For all who read will realize that in the great
struggle which convulsed Europe for more than four
years the men of Ulster did not fail.</p>

<h2 class="fs"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="drop-capx">The history of the 36th (Ulster) Division is published
under the patronage of the Right Hon. the Lord Carson
of Duncairn, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and
Major-General Sir O. S. W. Nugent, K.C.B., D.S.O.</p>

<p>Its publication once decided upon, the first step taken
was the formation of an influential Committee; the second,
that of a Guarantee Fund to cover the whole cost of its
production, which was, within a few weeks, largely over-subscribed.</p>

<p>The materials upon which the History is chiefly based
are the official War Diaries in the possession of the
Historical Section (Military Branch) of the Committee of
Imperial Defence. To the officials at 2, Cavendish Square
I am indebted for courtesy and assistance in matters of
difficulty. I have made use also of a very large number
of contributions sent to me by those who served with the
Division, from Sir James Craig and Sir Oliver Nugent to
several private soldiers. So long is the list that I cannot
acknowledge my debt to these contributors by name, but I
desire to thank one and all for material without which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
record would have been bald and dry, material which has,
I hope, enabled me to give some tinge of humanity to the
History. In several cases these personal contributions have
been of greater value still than this. They have&mdash;and this
is true especially of the Retreat of March, 1918&mdash;furnished
me with a record of incidents upon which official Diaries
throw no light. Two such incidents, in particular, the
defence of a company of the 12th Royal Irish Rifles at Le
Pontchu Quarry, near St. Quentin, on March the 21st, and
the last stand of the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles at Cugny, three
days later, have hitherto gone unrecorded, because the
survivors of these heroic episodes fell into the hands of
the enemy.</p>

<p>I have also to thank Sir Oliver Nugent, Colonel-Commandant
W. M. Withycombe, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.;
Brigadier-General C. J. Griffith, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.;
Brigadier-General A. St. Q. Ricardo, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O.;
Major H. F. Grant Suttie, D.S.O., M.C., and Major J. C.
Boyle for their trouble in reading the History in MS. and
for their many helpful suggestions. The Honours List, a
very big undertaking, is based almost entirely on the
compilation of Mr. Andrew Jardin, M.S.M., formerly Chief
Clerk in the Administrative Branch of Divisional Headquarters.
In this and other matters connected with the
History I have had much assistance from my wife.</p>

<p>The most important acknowledgment, on behalf of the
Committee and all interested in the publication of the work
as well as on my own, is due to Captain Kenneth M. Moore,
M.C., who acted as Honorary Secretary. The whole of the
business side of the undertaking has been conducted by him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
Into it he has thrown all his organizing ability and his
enthusiasm. No appeal has been made to him in vain.</p>

<p>I have only to add that it has been my endeavour to
make this History not a mere record of battles, but, so far
as space has permitted, a picture of life as it was lived in the
days of war. Lacking the second, the first is like dry bones
without flesh to cover them. If I have succeeded in
combining the two, I have right to hope that I have made a
contribution, however small, to history in a general sense,
as apart from military history.</p>

<p>It is to-day a favourite pretension that the war was as
uninteresting as it was terrible: a vast error, based upon
a temporary reaction, when not upon a pose. I made
recently the discovery that between 1906 and 1921 there
were published over one hundred books on the Napoleonic
Wars. The number would have been far greater but for the
fall in the publication of all books between 1914 and 1919.
So, a hundred years hence, men will be delving into our
records of the late war. Soldiers will be studying the lessons
of its battles. But a yet greater number of seekers will be
demanding with curiosity how men lived in such circumstances,
how they reacted to the strain of war, what
compensations they found. It behoves those who were
eye-witnesses to depict it in all its aspects, not to shrink
from discovering its horror, indeed, but also not to pretend
that it had not a better side. The picture now so often
painted, representing the war as a single scene in a torture
chamber, whence men emerged physical or mental wrecks,
may be good anti-militarist propaganda, but it is false,
because incomplete. From those experiences many men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
have emerged happy and strong. Many knew how to snatch
some happiness even from their midst. A far greater
number can see, in retrospect, that they played a part in one
of the most dramatic, as well as one of the most terrible,
tragedies in history. That stands for something of good,
amid all its evil, in any man's life. The comradeship of
war's days is a memory not less happy.</p>

<p>It is not alone because the story of the Ulster Division
is a record of courage and fortitude, in which men who
are my friends had part, but because it represents in a
microcosm man in one of the greatest and most curious
catastrophes the world has known, that I have had, however
unworthy of the task, a pleasure so intense in writing this
book.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Raising and Training of the Division:<br />
September 1914 to September 1915</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">It is no rightful part of the historian of a Division in the
Great War to embark upon preliminary sketches of the state
of Europe or of the movements in international politics that
preceded the catastrophe. If once he begin to seek for
causes he must seek far. Three pistol shots fired in the
narrow streets of Serajevo may be likened to an accidental
spark that explodes a great charge. But the charge was long
laid. War had been determined upon in Berlin. Without
that accidental spark, there can be no doubt that it would
shortly have been deliberately exploded by a detonator from
that quarter. If the divisional historian cannot trace the
laying of the charge, which had been accumulating, it may
be a hundred, and certainly fifty, years, let him not begin
by dealing with what were merely the final accretions. Let
him begin with the beginning of the war. War was declared
between this country and Germany on the 4th of
August, 1914.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain local circumstances anterior
to that declaration, which have an intimate connection with
the particular Division that is the subject of this History,
and so could not be omitted without robbing the latter
of much of its significance. The Ulster Division was not
created in a day. The roots from which it sprang went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
back into the troubled period before the war. Its life was
a continuance of the life of an earlier legion, a legion of
civilians banded together to protect themselves from the
consequences of legislation which they believed would affect
adversely their rights and privileges as citizens of the United
Kingdom&mdash;the Ulster Volunteer Force.</p>

<p>The Ulster Volunteer Force, or U.V.F., as it soon came
to be known the world around, was the creation of Sir
Edward Carson.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He believed that if the Imperial Parliament
were to persist in its declared intention of forcing the
Protestant population of Ulster into an Irish Parliament,
without its consent, the inevitable consequence would be
civil war in Ireland. Unorganized resistance would be ineffective,
and would beyond doubt lead to disorder and
unnecessary bloodshed. That the attempt would be made
appeared certain. The fate of the Government was bound
up with its Home Rule Bill. A failure to carry it through
would have involved instant defeat in the House of Commons,
wherein the Irish Nationalist Party held the balance
of power. All the signs pointed to a clash. It appeared
to Sir Edward Carson that the surest defence of the political
ideals of his followers lay in convincing the people of Great
Britain that Protestant Ulster would fight for the preservation
of liberties and traditions which it held dear, which, in
its eyes, were now menaced. It was in this faith that he
gave his approval to the formation of the U.V.F.</p>

<p>It was on the advice of Lord Roberts, a warm advocate
of Ulster's cause, that Sir Edward Carson invited General
Sir George Richardson to take command of the U.V.F.
Under his leadership the force was organized on a territorial
basis. At the outbreak of war it contained over 80,000 men
between the ages of seventeen and sixty-five, and a number
of women, enrolled not only as nurses but for many of those
supplementary services which were not allotted to women in
the European war until a comparatively late period. The
people of Ulster entered into their adventure in the same
spirit that they entered into that of the war when it came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a spirit of single-minded faith in their leaders and in themselves.
Admirably did Mr. Kipling sum up their attitude
in the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">Believe we dare not boast,</p>
<p class="verse">Believe we do not fear.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Probably their worst danger was over before the declaration
of war. The incident at the Curragh, as well as conferences
at the War Office, at Aldershot, and elsewhere, of
which the general public never knew, had made it clear that
the Army could not be used to enforce the legislation projected
at the cost of civil war. General John Gough, V.C.,
then Sir Douglas Haig's Chief of Staff, visited Ulster in
July, and stated that the idea of coercion was abandoned.
He is known to have formed the opinion that the Ulster
Volunteers could, with experienced leaders, be made a very
formidable fighting force. He, as well as the Government,
knew that those leaders would not have been lacking.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener, once at the War Office, was not long in
arriving at the same opinion as General Gough. He was
appointed Secretary of State for War on Wednesday the 5th
of August. On Friday the 7th he sent for Colonel T. E.
Hickman,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a Member of the House of Commons, President
of the British League for the Defence of Ulster, who had
acted as Inspector-General of the U.V.F., and said to him:
"I want the Ulster Volunteers."</p>

<p>Colonel Hickman replied: "You must see Carson and
Craig."</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener saw them. Sir Edward Carson's position
was not easy. He was most eager to help by every means
in his power. But he had a heavy responsibility towards
the people of Ulster. If the fighting men of the Province
were to go to the war, and in their absence a Home Rule Act,
such as they had banded themselves together to resist, were
to be forced upon those they had left behind, they would
have had cause to reproach him. The Prime Minister was
asked for an assurance with regard to the Home Rule Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
No definite assurance could be obtained from him. A
political truce had come into operation at the beginning of
hostilities, but it was ill-defined, and the Prime Minister
evidently did not see his way clearly out of the difficulties
of his situation.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Sir Edward raised some minor points,
asking that the word "Ulster" might succeed the number
of the Division which it was proposed to raise. To this
Lord Kitchener at first demurred, but the appelation was
subsequently granted.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A short delay ensued. The news from France was bad.
A meeting of the Ulster Unionist Members of Parliament,
attended by Lord Roberts, was held at Sir Edward Carson's
house in Eaton Place. The result of the meeting was that,
then and there, Colonel Hickman took a letter to Lord
Kitchener, offering the aid of Sir Edward and the Council
in raising as large a force as possible from the Ulster Volunteers,
without any conditions whatsoever. Later that day
there was another meeting between the Secretary for War
and the Ulster representatives at the War Office. At first
Lord Kitchener was modest in his demands, thinking that a
Brigade from the U.V.F. would be ample, at least as a start.
Captain Craig<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> assured him they could recruit a Division.
Lord Kitchener at once appointed Colonel Hickman and
Captain Craig as Chief Recruiting Officers for the Ulster
area.</p>

<p>Captain Craig, on leaving the War Office, jumped into
a taxicab in Whitehall and went straight to a firm of outfitters
with which he had had dealings in equipment for the
U.V.F., and gave an order for 10,000 complete outfits.
Returning to the House he was somewhat exercised in his
mind as to where the money was to come from to pay for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>all this. He spoke to Mr. Oliver Locker-Lampson,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> one of
Ulster's staunchest friends, who pulled out a cheque-book,
and said:</p>

<p>"Don't say another word! There's a thousand pounds:
to go on with, and nine more will follow in a day or two.
This is out of a special fund just available for your purpose."</p>

<p>In the first days of September Colonel Hickman and
Captain Craig crossed to Ireland to begin their work. On
the 3rd of the month Sir Edward Carson made a great
appeal, at a meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council in Belfast,
to the men of the U.V.F., urging them to come forward
for the defence of the Empire, the honour of Ulster and of
Ireland.</p>

<p>In Ireland much had happened meanwhile. A large
number of Ulstermen, the eager spirits who would not wait,
had already enlisted. Of these the greater number had gone
to the 10th Division, then being formed. Others had
crossed the Channel and joined Manchester and Glasgow
battalions. At Omagh Captain A. St. Q. Ricardo, D.S.O.,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Reserve of Officers, had been put in charge of the Depot,
and in mid-August had, anticipating the formation of an
Ulster Division, begun to recruit men from the Tyrone
Volunteers for a battalion of Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.
In a very short time he had two companies, which were, as
they had as yet no official status, attached to the 5th and 6th
Battalions of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. In these battalions
some of the officers subsequently elected to remain,
and went with the 10th Division to the Dardanelles. When
the Ulster Division was formed these two companies became
the nucleus of the senior battalion of the 109th Infantry
Brigade, the 9th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was an
exceptional incident, since Captain Ricardo, before taking up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>his duties at the Omagh Depot, had been Adjutant of the
Tyrone Regiment, U.V.F. Throughout Ulster, however,
a preliminary recruiting campaign had been carried out,
promises to enlist on the official formation of an Ulster
Division being obtained from members of the U.V.F.</p>

<p>The short delay may have lost a few men to the Ulster
Division, but it had created an atmosphere of expectation
and excitement. When the recruiting officers arrived the
men came forward with a rush, above all in Belfast. A
building near the Old Town Hall had been taken over.
As each man came out of the former after attestation, he
entered the latter, was passed from department to department,
emerging from another door a recruit in uniform,
leaving his civilian clothing to be packed up and sent home.
In this respect the Ulster Division was peculiarly fortunate.
The men who enlisted in it had not to endure those weeks
of drilling in wet weather in their civilian clothes, with inadequate
boots, which were productive of moral as well as
physical discomfort. For this advantage they were indebted
to the foresight and powers of organization of Captain Craig
and his assistants, the generosity of their friends, and the
aid of the big business men of Belfast; the work being
carried out without any cost to the State. Captain Craig
made further visits to the War Office, on one of which he
pointed out to Lord Kitchener that the camp accommodation
in Ulster was insufficient. Lord Kitchener replied that
such details must be arranged by others. Knowing him
well from South African days, when he had learned to regard
him with the highest admiration, Captain Craig answered
that it was all very well to talk in that autocratic manner,
but that at present he himself had not the weight behind
him to carry the matter through. The response was
characteristic. Lord Kitchener summoned in succession the
Adjutant-General, the Director of Personal Services, the
Quartermaster-General, and the Director of Fortifications,
and said to them:</p>

<p>"Take Craig away and see that he gets what he requires."</p>

<p>Captain Craig was then able to return to Ireland, and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
about the building of hutted camps at Clandeboye, Ballykinlar,
and Newtownards in the east, and Finner on the
Donegal coast.</p>

<p>The organization of the Division proceeded swiftly. A
large house, 29, Wellington Place, Belfast, was taken over
and equipped as Headquarters. Three Infantry Brigades
were formed: the 107th from the City of Belfast itself;
the 108th from the counties of Antrim, Down, Armagh,
Cavan, and Monaghan; the 109th from Tyrone, Londonderry,
Donegal, and Fermanagh, with one Belfast Battalion.
The Pioneer Battalion was also recruited in County Down,
mainly from the Lurgan area. The Royal Engineers, of
which two Field Companies only were raised at first, the
121st and 122nd, as well as the Divisional Signal Company,
came mainly from Belfast, above all from the great shipyards.
Royal Army Medical Corps personnel was recruited
and sent to Clandeboye, where, on the appointment of an
A.D.M.S., Colonel F. J. Greig, it was formed into three
Field Ambulances, the 108th, 109th, and 110th, and moved
to Newry. So successful was recruiting for the R.A.M.C.
that Colonel Greig was instructed by the War Office to
raise a Casualty Clearing Station, the 40th, which served
both in France and at Salonika. The Royal Army Service
Corps personnel was fine both in physique and intelligence.
The horses were good, as was natural, seeing how large was
the proportion of horses bought for the Army in Ireland,
and among the officers were some excellent horsemen and
horsemasters. Indeed the horsemastership in the Division
was throughout the campaign of a very high order, the Infantry
contriving to keep their mules sleek and fat and the
Artillery their gun-horses fit and well-groomed amid conditions
which none can realize who did not witness them.
A Cavalry Squadron and a Cyclist Company were also
formed, the former being unique in that it was a service
Squadron of the Inniskilling Dragoons.</p>

<p>One question which received much attention and gave
rise to much discussion was that of a Divisional Artillery.
It was reluctantly decided not to raise one in Ulster, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
this meant losing many an Ulsterman to other Divisions.
The U.V.F. had no artillery and consequently no partially
trained force upon which to draw. It was thought that the
raising and training of artillery in Ulster would take so long
that it might delay the departure to the front of the Division
for several months. In those days, it will be remembered,
the one feverish anxiety of the men of the New Armies
was lest the war should be over ere they were able to
play their part in it! In the event, as will later be
explained, the Division went to France in advance of the
Artillery that had been raised for it, with a Territorial
Artillery attached.</p>

<p>The 36th Divisional Artillery was raised, six months
after the rest of the Division, in the suburbs of London,
though from quarters stranger to one another than
towns fifty miles apart in Ireland. The 153rd and 154th
Brigades R.F.A. were formed by the British Empire League,
of which one of the moving spirits was General Sir Bindon
Blood. They were recruited chiefly from Croydon, Norbury,
and Sydenham. The 172nd and 173rd Brigades, on
the other hand, came from North-east London. They were
formed on the initiative of the Mayors of East and West
Ham and recruited from those districts.</p>

<p>The first date recorded in the Artillery annals is that of
May the 5th, 1915, when sixty recruits of the 153rd Brigade
assembled at 60, Victoria Street, the headquarters of the
British Empire League, and marched to Norbury, where
they were billeted in private houses. Londoners from South
and North did not meet until July, when the four Brigades
and the 36th Divisional Ammunition Column were moved
to Lewes. It was within a few days of the arrival of the
rest of the Division, already at a high standard of efficiency,
in England, that serious training of the Divisional Artillery
really began.</p>

<p>To the great regret of all Ulster, it was ruled that Sir
George Richardson, owing to the seniority of his rank, could
not take command of the Division. He remained in Belfast,
working for the good of the cause, and none can speak more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
highly of his efforts and his loyalty than Sir James Craig
and General Hickman, the chief organizers of those early
days. "Trusted by every class," writes an officer who had
long worked on his staff, "he was able to induce employers
to permit those of their workmen to enlist who were not
indispensable, and to perform the much more difficult task
of making the skilled craftsmen of the shipyards realize that
their duty to their country called them to remain at work,
helping the Navy and Merchant Service to hold command
of the sea, on which our success depended equally with our
victory on land." How they and others, notably the makers
of linen for aircraft, who were, for the most part, women,
played their part, cannot be discussed here, though it is
a record worthy the pen of a eulogist. What is less
generally known to the people of Great Britain is that
in Ulster not a strike occurred throughout the course of
the war.</p>

<p>Major-General C. H. Powell, C.B.,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> an officer with a
distinguished record in the Indian Army, was appointed to
the command of the Division. Colonel Hickman, after remaining
in Belfast till the three Brigades had been formed,
went to Finner to take command of the 109th.</p>

<p class="p1" />
<p>The present is perhaps the most suitable moment for
mention of the reserve battalions, of which six were formed
in 1915: the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Royal Irish Rifles,
12th Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, and 10th Royal Irish
Fusiliers. The 36th was the sole Irish Division to have its
own reserve formations. In addition to the provision of
drafts, these battalions had important tasks in the disturbed
period following the rebellion of Easter Week, 1916. A
detachment from the 18th Royal Irish Rifles, which battalion
was commanded by Colonel R. G. Sharman Crawford,
C.B.E., took part in the capture of "Liberty Hall."</p>

<p>Training was in full swing by the end of September,
1914, the 107th Brigade being at Ballykinlar, the 108th at
Clandeboye and Newtownards, and the 109th at Finner;
where the accommodation consisted at this early date almost
entirely of tents. By good chance the weather of the first
three weeks of October was fine and mild, but thereafter,
and before the hutting was completed, a very wet and severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
winter set in. The U.V.F. training was a great advantage.
It was easy to handle bodies of men, the most ignorant of
whom could at least number, form fours, march in step,
and keep alignment from the first. And the old organization
held till it could be replaced by the new. As one Commanding
Officer writes: "The U.V.F. officers and N.C.O.'s
kept the men in order till we straightened out into the
regular army formation." The enthusiasm of the men of
those days of 1914 is something that no officer who served
with them can ever forget; something perhaps, also, that
none but those officers who began their training in the first
six months of the war ever witnessed. There is a slow-burning
flame in the Ulster blood that keeps her sons, once
raised to the passion of great endeavour, at a high and steady
pitch of resolution. They took their work with extraordinary
seriousness. They were all anxiety to learn.
They made their platoon commanders, beginners for the
most part like themselves, struggle to keep ahead of them
in the art that both were acquiring. How many of the
junior officers must remember those "conferences" of
sergeants and section leaders after parade hours and the
circle of keen heads bent inward toward them; how many
the "parades" on the mess table, matches for sections,
inked on one side so that after many manœuvres the front
rank might remain the front!</p>

<p>The Infantry of the 36th Division was formed on perhaps
the most strictly territorial basis of any Division of
the New Armies; the general rule being that battalions
were drawn from the larger regimental areas of the U.V.F.,
companies from the smaller, and platoons from battalion
areas. This had the great advantage that it engendered
a natural companionship and spirit of pride in the units.
The company, the platoon, was a close community, an
enlarged family. In after days, in the trenches and in
billets behind the lines, the talk, not only of men from Belfast
and the larger towns, but of those from the country
villages, would be of streets and, in the latter case, of farms
and lanes of which those present had known every detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from childhood. The old clan-names of the Northumbrian
and Scottish Borders were clustered thick together. A
platoon would have five Armstrongs or Wilsons or Elliots,
a company half a dozen Irvines or Johnstons, a battalion
half a score of Morrows or Hannas. To be set against
that great accretion of moral force which springs from such
a survival of the clan was the minor disadvantage that the
non-commissioned officers for the most part, and certainly
all the juniors amongst them, were the brothers and cousins
and close companions of the men they commanded. It
was not that their orders were disobeyed; it was rather
that there was at first a diffidence about the orders, which
sometimes appeared to be rather in the nature of persuasive
requests. In a few units the non-commissioned officers
were changed about, so that they came in contact with men
with whom they were less familiar. But the problem was
never a serious one, and it finally disappeared. The only
other disciplinary problem was that of week-end leave.
The great bulk of the men of the 107th and 108th Brigades
and most of the Divisional Troops were training near their
homes. They could not understand why they should be
kept in camp doing nothing on Sundays when they might
have been visiting them. Though leave was given generously
enough, this remained a sore point till the Division
moved to England. Apart from "absence without leave"
there was no crime to speak of. Such occasional blackguards
as were found in the ranks were swiftly disposed
of, a sentence of "discharged as incorrigible and worthless,"
which was, as a fact, quite illegal in time of war, being their
fate.</p>

<p>The Divisional Commander was a firm believer in
marching, not only as a preparation for that feature of
military life, but as a creator of toughness and endurance
to meet the varied strain of war. By the early months of
1915 one brigade route march of from twenty to twenty-five
miles, and shorter battalion marches each week, had become
the general rule. Equipment being slow in making its
appearance, General Powell had rucksacks, of the Alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pattern, made in Belfast, to be carried, fully loaded, on the
march instead of the pack, and bolts from the shipyards to
take the place of small-arm ammunition in the pouches.
There was, as might be expected, some grumbling at what
appeared to be a needless imposition, but the troops benefited
by the experience, and Sir Archibald Murray, when
they marched past him the following summer, remarked
how easily they carried their packs. Numerous recruiting
marches were also carried out, which provided further
training in marching and march-discipline, and at the same
time exhibited detachments of the units from the countryside
to the remotest villages in their area. Everywhere
they were received with the greatest pride and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>For the rest, the training was that of all the New Armies.
The Infantry had "D.P." rifles, the R.E. for a long time no
material save what was bought for them. Little musketry
could be carried out, such as there was being done with a
handful of short service rifles allotted to each battalion,
and in some cases with rifles borrowed from the U.V.F.&mdash;upon
which inspecting Generals turned a blind eye. By
Infantry and Sappers alike trenches were dug, as an officer
of the latter acidly remarks, about eighteen inches wide and
with perpendicular sides. But that, of course, was a universal
experience. Much discussion took place upon the
relative merits of trenches sited upon the forward and
reverse slopes of undulating ground. Not till 1918, and
then to an extent but small, was any choice to be left by the
enemy in the siting of positions. The R.A.M.C. was the
first to be equipped. The people of Ulster showed its
affection for its Division by the presentation of very fine
motor ambulances, each of which bore inscribed upon the
body the name of the town or association from which it
came. In some of these cars the gangway was sufficiently
wide to take two additional stretchers, which proved an
inestimable boon in the Battle of the Somme.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Major-General Sir C. H. Powell, K.C.B.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The winter, it has already been remarked, was a very
wet one. The health of the troops was generally good,
a few cases of that dreadful disease cerebro-spinal meningitis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>causing the medical staff its greatest anxiety. In order,
however, to spare the men as far as possible from strain
and discomfort, and to allow those that remained to be
accommodated in the huts as they were completed, some
units were moved out of the camps; the 9th Irish Fusiliers<a name="FNanchor_14a_14a" id="FNanchor_14a_14a"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
of the 108th Brigade, and the 11th Inniskillings<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of the
109th, for example, moving to barracks, the first to Holywood
and Belfast, the second to the town that gives the
regiment its name, Enniskillen. In January the 109th Brigade,
less the 10th Inniskillings, moved to Randalstown.
The 10th Inniskillings remained on the West coast till the
first days of May, suffering the wildest weather in their
exposed camp, but probably no worse than was suffered
by the rest of the Brigade in the first days at Randalstown,
which became such a quagmire that men who slipped from
the "duck-boards" between the huts sometimes sank to
their knees in the mud. As weather improved and the hutments
were completed, the full Brigades reassembled in
their camps, the 10th Inniskillings marching across Ireland,
from west coast to east, to rejoin. With the spring there
began a new era of intensive training.</p>

<p>Meanwhile had been fought the Marne, the Aisne, the
two Battles of Ypres, Neuve Chapelle. The life in France
was impossible to imagine for those who had not seen it.
Not all the marching and countermarching, the attacks, the
trench-digging, the bivouacks, and cooking of meals in the
open could print for the mind's eye an adequate picture of
that. But gradually, through letters, through the recitals
of wounded friends, men began to form some conception
of the realities of modern war, as fought against a race which,
for courage, endurance, and resource, ranked with the most
formidable warrior peoples of the world's history. The gas
attack in the Salient was evidence, if any were still needed,
of the temper of the new Germany. Men did not blanch,
but it was inevitable that, to the more seriously minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
among them at least, another and a grimmer picture than
that which had been present with them at the beginning
should form itself. They had answered many calls, chief
among them love of country in various aspects. Mingled
with this had been, however, the spirit of adventure. The
old rowel that had driven Ulstermen over the seas, making
them colonists and administrators, was sharpened again by
the war. It pricked on these young men, the flower of
their country. Now, perhaps, the spirit of happy adventure
faded a little, but it was replaced by that of hard resolution
and duty. The training had had its physical results. The
troops were strong and supple in their strength. But it
had had a moral result also. The Division was no longer
a mass of men, even of drilled and disciplined men. It
had become, in the mysterious fashion that such things
happen, welded into a whole, a spiritual unit. Little by
little the group-spirit had grown, till before the troops
quitted Ireland a sensitive observer might fancy he could
detect it whenever he came in contact with them.</p>

<p>One factor in this group-spirit and in the whole life of
the Division, which is here approached with diffidence, but
which could not be omitted from a faithful record, was the
element of religion. It is sometimes forgotten that the
Covenant of the seventeenth century was taken almost as
widely in Ulster as in Scotland. Undoubtedly something
of the old covenanting spirit, the old sense of the alliance
of "Bible and Sword," was reborn in these men. It was
the easier recreated because of the strength of religious
feeling which had existed in times of peace in Protestant
Ulster, one of the few parts of the country wherein the
reformed churches had not, by their own admission, lost
ground in the last thirty years. Religious feeling inspired
the men of Ulster in those days of training, and remained
with them in the days of war. The General commanding
the 4th Division, to which the 36th was attached for instruction
after its arrival in France, spoke of his astonishment
at finding so many Ulstermen reading their Bibles.
The writer of this book can bear witness from personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
observation that it was not uncommon to find a man sitting
on the fire-step of a front-line trench, reading one of the
small copies of the New Testament which were issued to
the troops by the people at home. The explanation was
that, on the one hand, religion was near and real to them;
on the other, that they were simple men. They saw no
reason to hide or disguise that which was a part of their
daily lives.</p>

<p>The people of Ulster were given an opportunity to see
their Division as a whole. On May the 8th it was inspected
by Major-General Sir Hugh McCalmont at Malone, afterwards
marching through Belfast, the salute being taken by
the General at the City Hall. It was a fine day; the City was
dressed in bunting, and the main streets rocked with a mass
of enthusiastic spectators, who had crowded in by special
train from all about the Province. The troops were to
remain two months longer in Ireland, always on the tiptoe
of expectation of a move, but that was the real farewell of
Ulster to the Division she had given to the nation.</p>

<p>Early in July the Division moved to Seaford, on the
Sussex coast, leaving the 9th Inniskillings to recruit at
Ballycastle from the shameful disease of German measles!
But a small proportion of those 15,000 men had ever previously
crossed the Irish Sea. The English were new to
them, as they were to the English. The impressions made
on either side were favourable. The men were treated
with the greatest kindliness, and, for their part, their
behaviour was excellent; reassuring, indeed, to some of
those residents who had been perturbed at the idea of this
incursion of "wild Irishmen." Not a few of the people
of Seaford, on seeing the announcement of this History in
the press, wrote to the author and spoke of their pleasant
memories of the Ulstermen's sojourn in the district. Seaford
made a fine training area. It was a healthy place,
and the splendid downs behind the town were ideal for
tactical exercises. Soon they were scored with white chalk
trenches. On one occasion, when the whole Division, with
the exception of the Artillery&mdash;Infantry, Cavalry, Cyclists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Engineers, R.A.S.C., and R.A.M.C.&mdash;had been engaged in
night manœuvres, it was discovered when dawn broke that
a deep trench had been cut across a very valuable gallop
belonging to an Alfriston training stable. An apologetic
letter was sent to the owner, who wrote back expressing his
pleasure that his ground had been put to a purpose so
useful, offered half his jumps to the mounted units and
young officers for practice, and scarcely hinted that he hoped
the occurrence would not be repeated.</p>

<p>In the last week of July, when the troops were carrying
out their usual routine of training, a message was received
that Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Murray, Deputy
Chief of the General Staff, would hold an immediate
inspection. The result was of great importance. Sir
Archibald Murray informed Lord Kitchener on his return
that the Ulster Division was worthy of a higher place than
it occupied on the latter's private list of troops for the front.
It was not Lord Kitchener's fashion to ponder such questions.</p>

<p>"I'll go and see them to-morrow!" was his reply.</p>

<p>At half-past four on the 26th of July came a telephone
message that the Division was to parade for Lord Kitchener
at 11 a.m. the following day.</p>

<p>July the 27th was a bright, sunny day. Lord Kitchener
came, dashed at the waiting horses with such speed that
before anyone could speak he was on the back of one with
a doubtful reputation, by no means intended for his riding,
and rode off. Colonel FitzGerald, his Military Secretary,
said he had never seen him better pleased, and was quite
unable to persuade him to leave the field for another engagement.
To General Powell he remarked that he was relieved
to find he had under his hand a Division ready for the front
at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>One incident of this inspection, related by the A.D.M.S.
of the Division, must be recorded, as it throws an interesting
light on Lord Kitchener's quickness of eye for and memory
of details. The personnel of the Field Ambulances was of
fine physique, the mounted men including many farmers'
sons. As the Field Ambulances passed the saluting point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Lord Kitchener turned to the A.D.M.S. with the remark:
"Those men are too fine for the R.A.M.C. You will have
to give me two hundred for the Artillery." The A.D.M.S.
replied that he hoped they would not be taken, as they had
undergone a very thorough training; to which Lord
Kitchener, raising his voice, simply repeated: "You will
have to give me some of those men for the Artillery."</p>

<p>A few days later an officer from the Adjutant-General's
department came down. He said that, at the moment, men
were in fact not particularly wanted for the Artillery, but that
as "K." had ordered it, they must be taken. The upshot was
that, from a large number who volunteered and some reinforcements
from Newry, one hundred and fifty were transferred
to the Artillery, with the promise that they should be used
to reinforce that of their own Division&mdash;a promise that, it
is to be feared, was not in the majority of their cases fulfilled.
The sequel came two months later, when Lord Kitchener
was present at the King's Review. On reaching the 108th
Field Ambulance, the A.D.M.S. rode out to take up his
position behind Lord Kitchener, who turned to him and
asked: "How many men did you send to the Artillery?"
"A hundred and fifty, sir." Lord Kitchener, somewhat
gruffly: "I thought I told you to send two hundred."
The A.D.M.S. thought it best to leave it at that.</p>

<p>Returning from the Seaford review, Sir Archibald
Murray pointed out to the Secretary for War that the 36th
Division was not quite so ready for France as he had supposed,
since, though it had had practice on the ranges at
Seaford, as well as in Ireland, it had not completed its
official musketry and machine-gun courses, and was not
equipped for the front. Nor was the training of the
Divisional Artillery, which Lord Kitchener had not seen,
nearly sufficiently advanced. Lord Kitchener gave orders
that musketry and equipment should at once be completed,
and that a fully trained Divisional Artillery should be attached
to the Division. Shortly afterwards he said to Sir
Edward Carson, referring no doubt to the New Armies only:
"Your Division of Ulstermen is the finest I have yet seen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to lack of accommodation it was a few weeks before
the Division moved to an area where its musketry could be
carried out. By the 2nd of September it was assembled at
Bordon and Bramshott. Here the final equipment arrived,
and there was feverish activity in fitting it. Here also the
musketry course was fired, for the most part with American
ammunition, which gave unsatisfactory results.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And
here the rest of the Division came to closer quarters with
its own Artillery, which had arrived at Bordon from Lewes
on August the 31st. To be frank, there was some dismay
when it was discovered how elementary was its training.
A year was the estimate by some regular officers of the time
needed to make it fit for service. The critics had yet to
learn what could be accomplished by intensive training,
directed from above with skill and energy, backed by hard
work, loyalty, and the swift intelligence of the Cockney
from below.</p>

<p>The senior officers were now sent to France for instructional
purposes, being attached to the 5th and 18th
Divisions. On their return, news met General Powell that
during his absence Major-General O. S. W. Nugent,
D.S.O.,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who had commanded a Brigade in France with
distinction, had been appointed to succeed him. The
grounds of the decision were unexceptionable: that Divisions
should be taken to France by general officers with
experience of the conditions of warfare in that country.
There was, however, throughout the Division, much sympathy
with General Powell, who had been allowed to make
his tour in the line in ignorance of the fact, which the staff
officers with whom he came in contact knew, that his successor
had been appointed. He received the honour of the
K.C.B. in recognition of his high services in the training
of the Division. Sir Herbert Powell finally went to Vladivostok
in charge of the British Red Cross. The new commander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>was to remain with the Division for over two and
a half years. To-day his name is universally associated
with it.</p>

<p>On September the 30th, the 36th (Ulster) Division, with
the 1st/1st London Territorial Artillery, was reviewed by
His Majesty King George the Fifth. It was desired not to
prolong unduly the march past, as His Majesty always insisted
on waiting till the last man had gone by, and General
Nugent decided that the Artillery should advance in column
of batteries, and the Infantry in column of half-companies
with reduced intervals. It was a high test, triumphantly
accomplished. Lord Kitchener informed General Sir A.
Hunter, G.O.C. Aldershot Command, that the inspection
was the quickest the King had made since the beginning of
the war: a triumph of staff work and of drill. None of
those who saw them is likely to forget the physique or the
bearing of that splendid body of men. It is hard to think
without emotion of what the Division was that day and the
fate that awaited it.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener was there again, smiling and obviously
well-pleased. His Majesty warmly congratulated General
Nugent, and, turning to Sir George Richardson, who was
present, told him what a fine Division had been given by
his Ulster Volunteers. As the King's motor-car overtook
some of the troops marching back to camp the men burst
out into wild cheering, so that the car swept along a loud-roaring
line&mdash;an unrehearsed and spontaneous exhibition of
loyalty.</p>

<p>At the time of His Majesty's inspection the Advance
Parties were already in France. In the first days of October
the Division crossed the Channel, the mounted portion and
transport to Havre, the dismounted to Boulogne.</p>

<p>The year of preparation for battle was over.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Division in France: October 1915 to June 1916</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">General Nugent and his Staff arrived at Boulogne at
midnight on the 3rd of October. Between the 5th and the
9th of the month the Division concentrated in the area
round Flesselles, where, some ten miles north of Amiens,
Divisional Headquarters were established. Here the troops
realized for the first time that France did not always mean
the firing-line. The sound of guns was, strangely enough,
heard less than it had been at Seaford, though the Vérey
lights that could be seen by night against the sky were
evidence of the proximity of the trenches. The countryside
of the Somme was poor of soil, though the industry of
the inhabitants extracted good crops from it, and curiously
unlike that of the North of Ireland in its absence of pasture.
It was, however, pleasant enough, high and rolling, the
sites of the little villages in the uplands determined by the
scanty water supply, but traversed by numerous streams in
the valleys, full of beautiful panoramas wherever woodland
interposed to break the monotony of its contours. The
villages were not uncomfortable so long as troops could be
widely spread. When, however, they were used as "staging
areas" and billeting was at all close, their poverty was only
too apparent.</p>

<p>Of this, some portions of the Division had early experience.
On October the 9th the 107th Brigade and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
1st/1st London Brigade R.F.A. moved up for attachment
to the 4th Division, and instruction in trench warfare. The
4th Division at this time held a wide and comparatively
quiet front north of the River Ancre, which had been taken
over from the French during the previous summer. The
general method of instruction in vogue was the attachment
of formations and units to those next larger; that is, a
battalion to an infantry brigade, a company to a battalion,
a battery to a brigade of artillery. The troops in this preliminary
experience of trench warfare suffered less from the
enemy than the elements. The weather was bad, roads and
trenches were wet; the billeting accommodation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> was
scanty, and while in rest behind the line, consisted almost
entirely of war-worn tents without floor-boards. The men
in those first days scarce seemed to notice these things, so
intense was their eagerness and curiosity. The conventional
and traditional grumble of the British private soldier, a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto
voce</i> accompaniment to the most generous efforts and the most
unselfish devotion, was forgotten here. One of the Brigadiers
of the 4th Division said of them:</p>

<p>"The men are extraordinarily quiet, and I thought at
first somewhat subdued, and put it down to the big marches
they had had. But when I came to talk to them I found
they were like new schoolboys, taking in everything, deadly
keen, and only afraid of one thing&mdash;letting down their unit
in any way. I have never seen any men with such quiet
confidence in themselves, in spite of their efforts to hide it."</p>

<p>The attachments lasted five days, the 107th Brigade
being the only one which was not divided between two
divisions in the line. Its attachment being complete, the
108th was sent up, two battalions to the 4th Division and
two to the 48th, further north. Then, towards the end of
the month, the 109th Brigade had its turn with the same
two Divisions. Meanwhile the R.E. Headquarters and the
three Field Companies had moved to Arquèves, to work on
the new Third Army Line, later to become important as
the Amiens Defences. At this task they were soon joined
by the 16th Rifles (Pioneers), while they also had as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
companions French Territorials. All worked hard and well,
though in the light of subsequent experience their trenches
were far too narrow, and their traverses too small by half.
The troops not under instruction in the line were kept hard
at work training, officers from the 4th Division having come
to initiate them into the mysteries of bombing&mdash;mysteries
to which they took in kindly fashion. One instructor declared
that the national sport of the Ulsterman, the throwing
of kidney-stones in street riots, was an admirable preparation
for bombing. Another introduction was to gas helmets, the
horrible bags of those days without even mouth-pieces.
Passing through a gas-chamber in these bags was unpleasant,
though accepted as a necessity, but "doubling" and
marching in them, as ordered by some zealous instructors,
was purgatory, and resulted in some of the men being
violently sick. On October the 21st the Division, except for
such infantry and artillery as were under instruction in
the line, moved slightly further west, toward Abbeville, to
a more comfortable and spacious area about Bernaville and
Canaples, with Headquarters at Domart-en-Ponthieu.</p>

<p>The Higher Command had decided that the 36th
Division was not to enter the line as a formation for the
present. The Battle of Loos was not long past, when troops
fresh from England had been pushed into the fight at its
fiercest and after very long marches, with disastrous results.
It was determined that in future divisions should be given
a chance gradually to accustom themselves to the conditions.
Another decision which had been arrived at was that New
Army and Territorial Divisions should receive an admixture
of thirty per cent. of regular infantry by the transfer of
brigades. Orders were received for the transfer of one
brigade to the 4th Division. The 107th, in the command
of which General W. M. Withycombe, C.M.G., had succeeded
General Couchman, was selected to go. The 12th
Brigade of the 4th Division was transferred to the 36th
Division in exchange.</p>

<p>By November the 4th the 107th Brigade, with its Light
Trench Mortar Battery, which had just arrived from England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and the 110th Field Ambulance, were clear of the 36th
Divisional area. On the 7th the 12th Brigade marched in
to take its place. The 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers of this
Brigade were transferred to the 108th Brigade in exchange for
the 11th Rifles, and the 2nd Essex to the 109th in exchange
for the 14th Rifles. These inter-divisional changes lasted
a month only. Any advantages they may have had were
found insufficient to counterbalance the dislike of the break-up
of their old formations felt by battalions of both Divisions.</p>

<p>The Division as now constituted passed a winter very
different from that of its expectations. Late in November
it moved down to Abbeville, with Headquarters at Pont
Remy, on the bank of the Somme just outside that city.
For the time it was concerned more with sanitation than
with war. Never was such cleaning of streets, such draining
of middens, such wholesale carting away of manure-heaps,
as when the Ulster Division marched into an area.
The inhabitants wondered and gaped, and a humorist
wrote home that the troops "were sweeping onward through
village after village in the North of France."</p>

<p>Some writers&mdash;among them, it is to be regretted, a well-known
dramatist and critic of Ulster birth&mdash;have spoken
unfavourably of the French peasant and his attitude to the
troops. There can be few men of the 36th Division who
look back upon the peasant-farmer of the Somme with anything
but affection and admiration. For their part, the
villagers testified by their letters and expressions of regret,
whenever a unit moved, how good had been the terms
between troops and civilians. The Calvinistic Ulsterman
was sometimes a little startled and pained at first on finding
a countryside so liberally besprinkled with shrines and
crucifixes, but, if he were a countryman, especially, he
made the surprising discovery that these countrymen of the
Somme were very like himself. They thought twice before
speaking once; they had a certain dourness; they did not
wear their hearts on their sleeves, though they were furnished
with those organs in the proper places.</p>

<p>On November the 26th two of the Field Companies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
121st and 150th, were returned by the Third Army, and
began to assist and supervise the infantry at work in the
villages. In view of the projected spring offensive, not
actually launched till after midsummer, all these back areas
were being prepared to accommodate large bodies of troops
in some comfort. Bunks were put into barns, the holes
which had appeared in the lath and mud walls, through
shortage of male labour in the villages, were repaired, and
excellent horse-lines, with standings of chalk and stone,
were built. The timber was cut locally and sawn by the
troops themselves, using their own saw-mill.</p>

<p>On November the 27th the Ulster Divisional Artillery,
so called at that date to distinguish it from the London
Territorial Artillery, which was known as the 36th Divisional
Artillery, landed at Havre, and joined the Division in
the area east of Abbeville. It had remained at Bordon
since the departure of the Division. Its training was not
yet complete, and it was to have a course of gunnery at
Cayeux, on the coast, south of the mouth of the Somme,
before entering the line. The only other important event,
from the military point of view, to be recorded before February,
was the formation of the 108th and 109th Machine-Gun
Companies, from personnel and guns withdrawn from
the battalions. To replace the guns each battalion was
issued with four Lewis guns, which number was gradually
increased till, a year later, it had been quadrupled.</p>

<p>Christmas 1915 was celebrated by the troops in their
billets with sport and festivities. Many units had bought
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'sucking pigs'">suckling pigs</ins> from the farmers, and fattened them in anticipation
of the event; none had failed to provide some
luxuries. The villagers took part in the merrymaking, and
in most of the officers' messes the people of the house drank
with their guests the toast of victory. For very many of
the men in those Somme villages it was one of the happiest
Christmases they had ever spent, and one on which they
looked back in after years with delight. Within a few days
the services of the Pioneers were lost for a long period to
the Division. They were ordered to construct, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Chief Engineer of the Third Army, a broad-gauge railway
line between Candas and Acheux. For the rest, there was
little change in the daily life of the Division. On New
Year's Day it moved back again to the area about Domart,
roughly that in which it had been previously billeted. The
same work&mdash;wood-cutting, repairing and "bunking" of
barns, construction of horse-lines&mdash;continued, with the exception
that it was done in different villages. When the
work was well in hand some training was interspersed with
it. Not till January the 30th was the Division ordered to
hold itself in readiness to take over a portion of the line.
It had passed the worst of the winter by no means disagreeably.</p>

<p>The 107th Brigade had existed in a fashion less idyllic.
On arrival in the 4th Division area two of its battalions,
the 8th and 15th Rifles, were transferred to the 10th and
11th Brigades respectively, while in exchange it received
three battalions, the 1st Rifle Brigade, 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers,
and 2nd Monmouths. Three days later it took over
the left sector of the 4th Division front, astride the Mailly-Maillet&mdash;Serre
Road, the Brigade Headquarters being in the
former village. Here for upwards of two months it remained,
alternating with the 10th Brigade in six-day tours
in the line. In November the weather was indifferent;
by December it became very bad indeed. Men sank in
the mud so that they had to be dug out by their comrades
with spades. The communication trenches were so deep
in water that they were for the most part impassable. Movement
from front to rear had to take place after dark, in the
open. "Trench feet," a disease then generally known as
"frost-bite," though caused by constant immersion of the
feet in water far above freezing-point, became prevalent.
Rubber thigh boots, most precious of boons to men in such
sectors, were all too rare as yet, and had to be doled out
with parsimony. Battle casualties were light in this sector,
but the life in it was very far from pleasant. On New
Year's Day the Brigade, now returned to its original formation,
exchanged it for the right sector of the front held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by 4th Division, south of the Mailly-Maillet&mdash;Serre Road.
Of this sector the chief peculiarity was a tiny parallelogram
of trenches jutting out from the British line on the high
ground east of Beaumont Hamel, known as the Redan.
It was a most unpleasant corner. In the first place, it was
not more than fifty yards from the German lines, and the
mine-craters which fringed its eastern edge, which were
occupied at night by British posts&mdash;a doubtful policy, as
it appears to-day&mdash;were in constant danger of surprise.
During the 107th Brigade's tour one post was, indeed,
bombed by the enemy and a man taken out of it. In the
second place, the Redan was the scene of constant mining,
and the bugbear of battalions in reserve, which had to send
up large working-parties to carry sandbags filled with chalk
for the miners. It was the one point in our trenches which
received fairly constant attention from German gunners, and
the average weekly casualties in this tiny lozenge were
probably higher than on the whole of the rest of the 4th
Division's front. One of the best pieces of work performed
by the 107th Brigade during this period was the construction,
by the 8th Rifles, in one night, of a trench a hundred yards
in length and protected by a double "apron" of wire, which
denied to the enemy ground which would have given him
important observation. The digging and wiring were
carried out without arousing the least suspicion among the
German sentries.</p>

<p>The Brigade had during these three months established
an excellent reputation, both for work and for demeanour
under fire. General Nugent had suggested the reconstitution
of the 36th Division on its old basis on the grounds
that, with three Brigades of Ulstermen, it would be more
homogeneous and of greater fighting value than as at present
constituted. This suggestion was favourably received.
The men had not been unhappy in the 4th Division, but
feelings of local patriotism were still strong in them, and
they were most anxious to return. It was announced that
the reconstitution&mdash;the first of any division so dismembered,
and the only one which occurred for some time&mdash;would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
take place simultaneously with the Division taking over a
portion of the front.</p>

<p>The 1st/1st London Artillery had departed, two howitzer
batteries to the East, and the remainder to the 38th
Division in Flanders. The original Artillery, henceforth
the 36th Divisional Artillery, was completing its training
on the coast. With its exception the whole Division now
marched linewards, between the 2nd and 6th of February.
The 4th Division had meanwhile extended its right flank,
and had the 11th Brigade on the right of the 107th, its outer
flank on the River Ancre, just east of Hamel. As the new
divisional boundaries were to be the Ancre and the Mailly-Maillet&mdash;Serre
Road, all that was necessary to complete the
relief and reconstitute the Division was for the 108th Brigade
to relieve the 11th. The 36th Division then took
over, at noon on February the 7th, its first line, with the
108th Brigade on the right, the 107th on the left, and the
109th in reserve. Headquarters were at the large village,
or small town, of Acheux.</p>

<p>Of the next six weeks there is little of interest to report,
save a heavy bombardment of the left flank of the 107th
Brigade and of the 12th Brigade to the north of it.
Shelling with 210, 105, and 77-mm. howitzers and field guns
lasted for about half an hour, after which the artillery lifted
range to rear lines and communication trenches. The 9th
Rifles at once manned their battered trenches, some men
getting out beyond the wire and opening rapid fire. There
was no attack, though a party of the enemy succeeded in
entering the trenches of the 12th Brigade, to be quickly
ejected. It was curious that in this, its first bombardment,
and a not inconsiderable one, the Division did not suffer
a casualty.</p>

<p>A mine exploded in front of the Redan cost the lives
of three men of an attached Tunnelling Company, who
were buried in a blown-in passage. Otherwise, during this
period the weather was probably an opponent more formidable
than the Germans. The men in the trenches
lived under conditions of the deepest discomfort. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
weeks together the communication trenches were knee-deep
in water. Previous troops had dug deep sumps in the bottoms
of the trenches, covering them with boards, with the
idea of draining off the water. But the water soon filled
these and rose till it floated off the boards. Then would
come some unfortunate fellow splashing his way along the
trench, to plunge into the hole and be soused in icy water
to the waist or higher. Some of the ills then endured were,
it must be admitted, not unavoidable. There was a certain
lack of revetting material, it is true. Few of those who
were compelled to use it will forget one notorious communication
trench, "Jacob's Ladder," which ran from the
village of Mesnil to that of Hamel, down a forward slope
completely exposed to the enemy. By night the road could
be followed without worse risk than occasional bursts of
machine-gun fire, so that large bodies of men had seldom
to use this trench. By day, however, men clawing their
way through its mud experienced the sensations of flies in
treacle. When time and material had become available for
the revetting of its sides, all this was changed, and "Jacob's
Ladder" lost much of its evil reputation. But on the front
line trenches more could have been done than was accomplished.
The chief methods of drainage employed were the
digging of large sumpholes in the parados of the trench to
carry off the water, and the pumping of it out over the
parapet with hand-pumps, whence, of course, it presently
filtered back to the trench bottom. Scientific trench drainage,
by means of trenches cut for the purpose, had as yet
made little progress, though the undulating character of the
country was suitable to it. It is scarcely an exaggeration
to say that the Division suffered more from the wet at this
time than during the following winter in Flanders, in flat
country and on a water-logged soil, simply because in the
latter case the R.E. and infantry had learnt by experience
how to deal with it.</p>

<p>If the 36th Division had yet something to learn by way
of prevention in these matters, it had little as regards cure.
When rubber boots&mdash;"gum-boots, thigh," in the parlance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the Ordnance&mdash;became commoner, "trench feet" almost disappeared.
The men laughed at the special grease with
which they were provided to rub their feet, but they used
it as they were ordered to do. Contrary to legend, but a
small proportion was really used for the frying of food.
They laughed also at the foot drill, each man rubbing the
feet of his next number once a day, but to a great extent
they carried it out. Excellent as these things were, the best
remedy of all was found to be dry socks. Drying them in
the trenches was difficult, but it was easy to send up dry
ones by the ration parties at night, who took back the wet
ones with them and dried them during the following day.</p>

<p>As this History is intended not alone for men who fought
in the war, but also for their relatives and friends at home,
a few remarks on the routine of holding a line of trenches,
commonplace to the soldier as they may be, are perhaps
permissible. Let us imagine a division with two brigades
in line, and one in reserve. Each of the brigades in line
would have two battalions in the trenches, relieved at
regular intervals, though never on the same night, by the
other two. These intervals were from four to eight days,
according to the weather and state of the trenches. The
distance of the rest billets from the front line, again, depended
upon accommodation, the enemy's command of the
country from his observation posts, and the activity of his
artillery. They might be three or four miles back. At this
time the battalion which held the line at Hamel, on the
right bank of the Ancre, rested in Mesnil, little more than
a mile from the German lines. The battalion in the
trenches had probably two companies in the front line, one
in support and one in reserve, and carried out inter-battalion
reliefs in the course of its tour. The front and
support lines were held by posts consisting of sections, about
ten or twelve men in these early days, half as many later on.
These posts furnished each a single sentry by day, and
double sentries by night. For half an hour before and half
an hour after dawn, the hour of surprise attacks, the troops
would "stand to" in their trenches. In winter months this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was the hour of the rum-ration&mdash;very welcome after a cold
or wet night. Each company had one officer permanently
on duty in the trench, night and day. In the trenches
these periods were practically reversed. Night was the
time when most of the work, all the wiring, all the patrolling
of "No Man's Land," was carried out. Roughly
speaking, the battalion in the line was responsible for the
work as far back as its headquarters, with the expert assistance
of a few sappers. Behind that worked the resting
battalion&mdash;though parties from this had frequently to assist
the battalion in line also&mdash;under the direction of the R.E.,
of which one Field Company was in general attached to
each brigade. It was important that the infantry should
know the sappers, and look upon them as assistants rather
than task-masters. The Pioneer battalion had generally
some special task of importance allotted to it under the
direction of the C.R.E.</p>

<p>A Machine-Gun Company at this time formed part of
each brigade. The guns were distributed in depth in the
trenches, but much further forward than was the case later
on, when the number of Lewis guns with the infantry had
been increased. Such subtleties as machine-gun barrages,
indirect fire, the linking of guns by telephone to battalion
headquarters, had as yet scarce been conceived. Machine
gunners and infantry had their ammunition and bombs in
boxes let into the parapet, these stores increasing in size
from front to rear.</p>

<p>The artillery, in rear, was also distributed in depth.
Covering two brigades, as we have imagined, it would probably
be divided into two groups, the group commander
living at or near the headquarters of his infantry brigade.
For this purpose the present formation, four artillery brigades,
of which one was a howitzer brigade, was clumsy
and extravagant. The howitzer brigade, for example, was
invariably split between the groups, and its commander
"functioned" as an administrator, but not as a combatant.
This system was to be modified later. The guns were in
pits, hidden as well as possible among trees or houses, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
if in the open covered with "camouflage" to match the
surrounding fields. The dug-outs of their detachments
were close at hand, and, close at hand also, were pits containing
from two to four hundred rounds per gun. At
dusk the guns were laid on the "night-lines"; that is to say,
each was set so as to fire upon a certain zone, in accordance
with a previously arranged plan. A sentry in an observation
post watched the line. Within a few seconds of a
telephone call or an "S.O.S." rocket going up, the guns
could open fire. An artillery liaison officer lived with each
battalion in the trenches.</p>

<p>The rations arrived each day for all these people in the
following manner: The Divisional Supply Column went
daily to railhead with its lorries to meet the "pack train,"
bringing up the supplies to the "refilling point," and dividing
them into four groups, one for each infantry brigade
and one for all the rest of the divisional units. Here, under
the supervision of the Brigade Supply Officer, the supplies
were parcelled out, loaded into the horsed supply wagons,
and taken to the transport lines of the units, where they
came into the keeping of the Quartermaster. In a very
quiet part of the front, when the railhead was far advanced,
the supply wagons could draw direct from the railhead,
cutting out altogether the Supply Column and its lorries.
Divisions were urged to do this when possible to save petrol.
Let not the innocent, however, imagine that uses were not
found for the lorries thus set at liberty!</p>

<p>The food we need follow no further, except in the case
of a battalion in the trenches. For all other units its preparation
was comparatively simple. But to supply the man
on the fire-step with hot food at regular intervals was a
problem of some difficulty. Rations were brought up to
battalion headquarters after dusk by the transport. In a
well-organized battalion&mdash;and battalions varied much in this
respect&mdash;the maximum was done before the food left the
transport lines, the minimum when it arrived. That minimum
was the heating. In some sectors of the front it used
to be said that cooking was impossible. As a fact, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
never was a sector wherein, with resource and ingenuity, at
least the <em>heating</em> of food already prepared was impracticable.
For extras, the stock-pot was the soldier's best friend; and
unhappy was he if his battalion did not possess it. Ration
biscuit, soaked in stock and put through a mincing machine,
made "dough" which produced cheese biscuits, sausage
rolls, jam tarts. As for the dry rations, tobacco, etc., they
were put into a sandbag for each section, labelled with the
number of that section. So, at least, marched affairs in a
battalion of which the internal economy was at a high stage
of efficiency.</p>

<p>The evacuation of wounded may also be briefly described.
On a casualty occurring the wounded man was
brought by the regimental stretcher-bearers to the Regimental
Aid Post, a dug-out or shelter near a communication
trench, generally in the neighbourhood of battalion headquarters.
A mile or two further back was the Advanced
Dressing Station, to which the Field Ambulance stretcher-bearers
carried "lying-down" cases and conducted "walking"
cases. If possible, wheeled stretchers or a trench tramway
were here employed. At the A.D.S. food in some form was
always ready; wounds were re-dressed if necessary, morphia
given if required, and the soothing cigarette added. Then
the cars of the Field Ambulance conveyed the casualty to
the Main Dressing Station; <em>i.e.</em>, the headquarters of the
Field Ambulance. This was to all intents and purposes a
temporary hospital, where the wounded man might obtain
rest, and further surgical aid if required. It was the last
stage in the divisional chain. From it the cars of the Motor
Ambulance convoy took him to the Casualty Clearing
Station, whence a hospital train bore him to the base hospital
or, during an offensive, direct to the hospital ship.</p>

<p>The above is an attempt to sketch, without entering
into its ten thousand complications, some of the main features
of the life of a man in the trenches. War, at that time
and in such a sector as this, had not acquired many of the
horrors that were to come. Bombing by aeroplanes was in
its infancy; so was the use of gas shell. Long-range shelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of villages with high-velocity guns was almost unheard
of hereabouts. With regard to all shelling there would
appear to have been conventions. Those who have seen
German shells at Mailly-Maillet dropping at dusk, the
hour when the transport started for the line, on to the Serre
and Auchonvillers Roads, but never closer than one hundred
yards to the first houses of the village, will agree with this
opinion. The surroundings were far less grisly and depressing
than they afterwards became. There was, it must be
remembered, save that at Ypres and that which at the
moment was being fashioned at Verdun, no devastated area
wider than a narrow ribbon from the coast to Switzerland.
From the Mesnil Ridge, where the observation posts of the
Division were manned by the Cyclist Company, the country
behind the enemy's lines showed green and smiling. Villages
which the troops were not to see at close hand save
as ruins, Irles, Pys, Grévillers, Bihucourt, were intact.
The time could be read with the aid of a telescope by the
church clock of Bapaume. On the British side, villages a
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'couples of mile'">couple of miles</ins> back were little disturbed. Martinsart was
no farther from the enemy, and here it was possible to call
on Brigade headquarters at their château as one returned
from the trenches, and drink a cup of tea poured out by the
daughter of the house, who rang for a British orderly to
bring hot water. Mediæval idyll! With spring appearing,
the trenches drying, and the grasses above them filled with
field flowers; with the Valley of the Ancre taking on a new
beauty as its trees were feathered green; with nature
bursting into life, man's thoughts could not be ever fixed
upon death. Warfare, to many of the men in the Division,
must have seemed less than terrible in these days. But
they were the last of the good days. The terrible was not
far off.</p>

<p>In the first week of March the Division extended its
front, the 109th Brigade taking over the sector south of the
Ancre, known by the name of Thiepval Wood. At the
same time the 36th Divisional Artillery, back from its final
training at Cayeux, took over the defence of the long line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
By the last day of the month the latter had been shortened
to the two-battalion front astride the Ancre, the 31st Division
having come into line on the left. The two sub-sectors
were known as Thiepval Wood and Hamel respectively.
The Hamel sub-sector was comfortable and quiet, troubled
by nothing worse than the aggressions of a new long-range
medium trench mortar, which often smashed in its communication
trenches, but seldom caused many casualties.
The battalion which held it was responsible for the defence
of the Ancre and its swampy valley, filled with miniature
lakes. This was carried out by the reserve company in the
village, which found a platoon for small and isolated posts,
the most advanced being at the bridge on the Thiepval-Hamel
Road. The men enjoyed this duty better than any
other. They were never shelled, they had no work to do,
and they could employ their leisure fishing in the stream,
with the chance of an occasional shot at wild duck or widgeon.
Thiepval Wood, on the other hand, with an appearance of
quietude that deceived visitors and newcomers, was wont to
be transformed by sudden and not infrequent bombardments
into a very unpleasant spot indeed. It was here
that on the 10th of March the 10th Inniskillings suffered
their real baptism of fire. At three in the afternoon there
had been ranging shots from all calibres of artillery upon
the wood, strengthening the belief of the man in the line,
which was accepted with some hesitation by the Staff, that
the army opposite possessed a "travelling circus" of
heavy artillery, moved from point to point for the covering
of raids. Precisely at midnight came a roar of explosions,
a whistle and screaming of shells, a crash of falling trees.
All telephone lines were cut, and S.O.S. rockets failed to
ignite, but the artillery soon opened fire on its own initiative.
On the right of the battalion front the trenches were
pounded beyond recognition, and soon littered with dead
and wounded. The garrison of the trenches manned their
fire-steps and opened rapid fire on the enemy's front line.
Not till 2 a.m. did the shelling die down. Then it was
found that the enemy had penetrated the trenches of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>troops on the right of the Division, killing a number of
officers and men, and taking several prisoners. In a Special
Order of the Day, congratulating the 10th Inniskillings, the
Divisional Commander stated that "there seemed no reason
to doubt that the German bombardment was intended to
cover a raid similar to the raid which actually took place
elsewhere the same night." The battalion had the further
honour of mention in the despatches of Sir Douglas Haig.
Its losses amounted to some thirty killed and wounded.</p>

</div>

<p>From the moment when the Division first entered the
line, preparations had been made for the long-planned
offensive. By the month of May this work was intensified.
It is difficult to give in a few lines an adequate idea of the
scope of such preliminary labour. The mere plans and
instructions issued by the Staffs of the Division, its formations
and units, would fill the greater part of this volume.
There were miles of tramway to be laid, gun-pits for the
new artillery to be constructed, roads to be improved, new
communication trenches cut, and innumerable dug-outs excavated.
The heaviest task of all was the building of two
causeways over the Ancre and its marshes; the only communications
with our line on the left bank of the river being
some crazy wooden foot-bridges put up by French troops.
As a first step the drainage of the marshes was examined,
and many obstructions in the small streams removed. The
flooded area was thus decreased, but there were at first
frantic protests from the Division on the right when the water
rose behind its lines. This flooding was, however, but
temporary. The construction of these causeways was entrusted
to the 122nd Field Company R.E., which employed
large infantry working parties in two shifts, from dusk to
dawn. The causeways were built of sandbags filled with
chalk. The river was constantly swept at night by machine-gun
fire, and the casualties suffered were not inconsiderable,
particularly on the northern causeway. The mainstay
of the whole scheme of preparation was the Pioneer battalion,
which had already made its name by the construction of the
Candas-Acheux railway. It was for this battalion a proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
day when railhead for supplies and personnel opened at Belle
Eglise Farm on the line that was its handiwork. But the
whole of the Division worked with a will also. Tasks were
nearly always completed before the allotted time, for which
the sole explanation lay not entirely in the good hearts of
the men, but also in the splendid physique of the Division
at this period.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The artillery dug on the Mesnil Ridge an
observation trench known as "Brock's Benefit," in honour
of their General, which contained a whole series of "O.P.s,"
and will be very well remembered by a long series of
divisions subsequently inhabiting that sector.</p>

<p>The first raid carried out by the Division was on May
the 7th, and, by an extraordinary coincidence, that night was
also chosen by the enemy to raid the troops of the 32nd
Division on its right, at a point about 200 yards west of that
of the British raid. The German barrage opened at 11 p.m.;
the British "zero" was midnight. Major Peacocke,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> second-in-command
of the 9th Inniskillings, had his party already
out in the sunken Thiepval-Hamel Road when the German
bombardment began. He spoke on a telephone which he
had taken out with him to his commanding officer, Colonel
Ricardo, and it was decided to carry through the raid. The
British guns, trained on the barrage lines selected for the
raid, held their fire, and a most uncomfortable hour had to
be endured in Thiepval Wood. At midnight the British
barrage opened and the raiders charged in. The enemy was
on the alert, and a fierce struggle followed. The raid was
successful in inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. No
prisoners were taken, as the Germans in the deep dug-outs
showed fight, firing up the steps. The raiders thereupon
bombed the dug-outs till all sounds of life below had ceased.
The casualties were trifling, but there were a good many
more in the sunken road, where the raiding party had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>lie two hours before it could return to its trenches, so heavy
was the German barrage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the enemy's intentions with regard to the
troops on the right of the 36th Division being only too
clear, six platoons of the 10th Inniskillings, two from dug-outs
on the reverse slope of Thiepval Wood, and a company
from Authuille, moved up to their support. The former
body arrived in the front line of the 1st Dorsets in time to
assist them in repelling the enemy, who left a dead officer
and a wounded prisoner in the hands of the English battalion.
The company from Authuille and two guns of the
109th Machine-Gun Company also pushed up through a
very heavy barrage to the front line. The Dorsets had
suffered very considerable casualties, and the troops of the
Ulster Division assisted to man their line till morning.
The appreciation of the 32nd Division was warmly expressed
by the G.O.C.</p>

<p>In May took place the first reorganization of the Divisional
Artillery, the object of which was to divide the howitzers
among the Brigades, to overcome the disadvantages
of which there has been mention. Three of the Brigades,
the 153rd, the 172nd, and the 173rd, were made up of three
four-gun 18-pounder batteries and one four-gun 4.5 howitzer
battery. The fourth, the 154th Brigade, which had
been the Howitzer Brigade, thus lost all its howitzer batteries,
and was made up by three 18-pounder batteries,
one from each of the other Brigades, in exchange for the
howitzers. Brigade Ammunition Columns were abolished
and the Divisional Ammunition Column largely increased.</p>

<p>At the end of May Brigadier-General Hickman, commanding
the 109th Brigade, returned to England, being
succeeded by Brigadier-General R. Shuter, D.S.O. General
Hickman, whose part in the formation of the Division has
been recorded, was the last of the Infantry Brigadiers who
had accompanied the Division to France. General Hacket
Pain, commanding the 108th Brigade, had been succeeded
by Brigadier-General C. R. J. Griffith, C.M.G., D.S.O., on
December the 4th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>With the month of June began those more detailed preparations
for the offensive which must be reserved for the
chapter that deals with it. By this time all ranks had become
aware of what was brewing. A keen sense of
expectation was in the air. The Division had become a
living soul ere ever it crossed the Channel. The months
of trench warfare had strengthened it to an inestimable
extent. The men were keyed up to a very high pitch of
daring and determination. The infantry had the utmost
confidence in itself, and in the artillery which was to support
it. Officers and men of these two arms had known each
other but a short time, but already a personal liaison, unusually
close, to grow even closer during the comparatively
quiet months in Flanders, had been established between
them. The Division was to do great deeds in after days,
and upon other fields of battle, but never was there quite
the same generous and noble enthusiasm with which it
entered upon this, its first offensive. That which it was
about to accomplish will live in memory as long as there
is a British Empire to honour the exploits of British arms.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Battle of the Somme: July 1st, 1916</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">On the first day of June, 1916, the front of the 36th Division
was held by the 107th Brigade, the 108th being in
support in the neighbourhood of Martinsart, and the 109th
training. To permit the two latter Brigades to train together,
the 147th Brigade of the 49th Division was ordered
to relieve the 108th and take over its working parties. The
108th Brigade then moved back to Varennes, and the neighbouring
villages of Harponville and Léalvillers. Training
was carried out over an elaborate system of dummy trenches
marked out with plough and spade, near Clairfaye Farm,
to represent those of the German system to be attacked.
It was largely due to this preparation that the men knew
their task so well, and were able to push on to their objectives
when their leaders had fallen. On the 5th a raid was
carried out by a party of the 12th Rifles, sent up from the
training area, on the German sap that ran parallel with the
main railway line north of the Ancre.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The wire was cut
by an ammonal torpedo. This was a zinc tube, three
inches in diameter, filled with ammonal. Each tube was
about six feet in length, but tubes could be connected up
with bayonet joints, and any length of torpedo thus made.
It was generally fired by a sapper accompanying the raiding
party. The Germans had run back or taken to their dug-outs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
under the fire of our artillery, and few were seen. The
dug-outs were bombed, and an officer shot. Two tunnels
leading toward the British lines were discovered, one containing
fourteen high-tension copper wires, which seemed
to point to mining with a mechanical digger. The heads
of these saps were blown in by the engineers who accompanied
the raiding party. Five nights later the Germans
retaliated upon the little salient in the British line opposite,
known as the William Redan, then held by the 15th Rifles.
After our trenches had been pounded by a bombardment
of half an hour, the raiders advanced. They suffered loss
from our barrage, and not more than half a dozen ever
actually entered our trench. Half a minute's bitter hand-to-hand
fighting, and they were out of it again, bearing
with them the leader of the raid, who had been shot by
a British officer. Our trenches were considerably damaged,
but casualties were not heavy.</p>

<p>The weather now took a turn for the worse, there being
a sort of cloud-burst on the 12th. Cross-country tracks
were impassable for infantry, and the carriage of ammunition
to the new gun positions was a very heavy task. The rain
came at an unfortunate moment. Battalions of the 109th
Brigade were moving up to Aveluy Wood, south of Mesnil,
to complete the work of preparation. The 16th Rifles
(Pioneers) were there already. These troops had to endure
the gravest discomfort from the weather. Little canvas
shelters were all their protection, and for days together
their clothes were not dry. Yet their work was magnificent.
When, almost at the last moment, a Regiment of French
Field Artillery joined the Division to assist in the attack,
the 11th Inniskillings were ordered to help them in the
construction of gun-pits and shelters, with little enough
time to do it. The men threw themselves into the task
with splendid enthusiasm. It seemed that they worked the
harder because their work was for strangers, who would
be left half-protected if they failed them. There was a fine
flavour of international courtesy in the manner of their toil,
for they gave of their free will energy that not the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
skilful of taskmasters could have wrung from them. General
Nugent sent to Colonel Brush, then in command of the
Battalion, a letter of warm congratulation upon their
efforts.</p>

<p>In the battle that was about to begin, General Sir H.
Rawlinson's Fourth Army was taking the offensive along
its whole front, with the Sixth French Army of General
Fayolle on its right. The Battle of the Somme, the first
in which our New Armies of volunteers were engaged in
great numbers, concerned the 36th Division but at its opening.
Its general aspects were, however, of the highest
importance to all the Allied troops. It differed broadly
from such an action as that of Loos. There an immediate
strategic result was sought from a small offensive. Here,
while a break through was sought on the first day, and would
doubtless have been possible had the whole German trench
system been captured all along the front, thereafter the aims
became quite other. On the vast plateau of Picardy, an
advance of ten miles or thereabouts had small strategic
importance. The nearest first-class railway junction, Cambrai,
was thirty miles away. The new phase was the
"limited offensive." The plan was to push forward infantry
behind artillery fire of overwhelming weight upon
a broad front, step by step, smashing down resistance. The
plan was made possible for us by the huge development of
our munition factories. It was the war of attrition. It
was a mighty assault battle, wherein England and France
hurled man and gun and material upon German man and
gun and material. It had manifold and obvious blemishes.
Its cost was prodigious, particularly in its early stages,
before certain needful lessons had been learnt. It stereotyped
attack and robbed commanders of initiative, and was
in this respect the text-book of all the lessons Ludendorff
impressed upon his troops in the first three months of 1918.
But&mdash;and of this there can be no shadow of doubt to-day&mdash;it
laid the foundations of final victory.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
troops were never quite the same after it, while our young
levies, dreadful as were their sacrifices, were to arrive at a
far higher standard of military value.</p>

<p>The 36th Division was the left Division of the X. Corps,
having on its right the 32nd Division and on its left the
29th Division, not long arrived from the East, which was
in the VIII. Corps. The 49th Division was in X. Corps
Reserve. The 36th Division was to attack astride the
Ancre. On the left, or southern bank, its objective was
the fifth line of German trenches, known as the "D"
line.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The right flank boundary ran from the north-east
corner of Thiepval Wood to D 8. On the right bank the
objective was a triangle of trenches enclosed between the
left boundary line and the Ancre, beyond Beaucourt Station.
The left boundary ran from the point of the salient in our
lines, known as the Mary Redan, to two houses half-way
between Beaucourt and its railway station, thence along the
river to the railway bridge. The ground rose sharply on
either side from the deep-cut bed of the Ancre, but while
on the northern bank it was cut by a gorge running down
from the village of Beaumont-Hamel, at right angles to the
river, and parallel with the German trenches, on the south
it swelled up in a great convex curve, rising two hundred
and fifty feet in a thousand yards. The crest was crowned
by a parallelogram of trenches, extending from the German
"B" line to the "C" line, that will live long in history
as the Schwaben Redoubt. The trenches were defended by
masses of wire. An artillery officer, who made a careful
reconnaissance with a good glass from "Brock's Benefit,"
on the Mesnil Ridge, counted sixteen rows guarding the
front line just south of the river, and an average of five
rows along the second line. The dug-outs, most of them
at least thirty feet deep in the chalk, were to all intents and
purposes shell-proof, and were numerous enough to house
the whole trench garrison. The enormous activity behind
our lines had taught the Germans long before that an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was brewing. They trusted to their fortifications and
awaited it with confidence.</p>

<p>For the purposes of attack, the front was divided into
four sections. The right and right centre sections were allotted
to the 109th and 108th Brigades respectively. The
left centre section, bounded by a line drawn from the north
corner of Thiepval Wood just north of B 19, C 11, and
D 11, and the Ancre, was, owing to the great frontage of
the 36th Division, not to be attacked directly. The left
section, on the right bank of the Ancre, was allotted to the
108th Brigade. This Brigade had attached to it one battalion
of the 107th. It was to employ three battalions in
the right centre section, and two in the left section. The
107th Brigade (less one battalion) was in Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>The task of the 109th Brigade in the right section was
to attack the "A" and "B" lines within its section,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
to advance to a line drawn from C 8 through B 16 to the
Grandcourt-Thiepval Road at C 9; there to halt and consolidate.
For this purpose General Shuter was attacking
with two battalions, the 9th Inniskillings on the right, the
10th on the left, in first line; and the two remaining, 11th
Inniskillings on right and 14th Rifles on left, in second.
The two first were to take and consolidate the final objective,
the rear battalions to hold the "A" and "B" lines and to
send up liaison patrols to get touch with the leading battalions.
The most important task of the 11th Inniskillings
was the fortification of the Crucifix on the Thiepval-Grandcourt
Road.</p>

<p>The task of the 108th Brigade in the right centre section
was to clear the "A" and "B" lines within the section,
and advance to the "C" line, halting and consolidating
on the salient C 9, C 10, C 11, the north-east corner of the
Schwaben Redoubt. A special detachment, with one
Stokes mortar, one Lewis and one Vickers gun, was to act
as left flank guard, to clear the communication trench from
B 19 to C 12, holding the latter as a defensive post, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sending a detachment down to C 13, to ensure observation
and fire on the Grandcourt-St. Pierre Divion Road. In
addition, two officers' patrols, each a platoon in strength,
with a Lewis gun, were to reconnoitre and clear the left
of the "A" and "B" lines up to St. Pierre Divion.
General Griffith was attacking here with the 11th Rifles on
the right, the 13th on the left, and the 15th Rifles of the
107th Brigade, attached, in support.</p>

<p>North of the Ancre, in the left section, the task allotted
to the two remaining battalions of the 108th Brigade was
to assault the German salient on the left of its objective
and clear the trenches down to the railway, to establish strong
points at B 26, B 24, and B 21, and to occupy Beaucourt
Station and the trenches immediately behind it. It was
afterwards to occupy the mill on the river bank and the
two houses beyond the station. Here the 9th Irish Fusiliers
were attacking on the right, and the 12th Rifles on the
left. Of the latter battalion one platoon was detailed to
attack the railway sap, of which mention has already been
made, and one to patrol the marsh.</p>

<p>The assault on the "D" line, the final objective, was
to be carried out by the 107th Brigade with its three remaining
battalions. The Brigade was to advance through
Thiepval Wood, following the 109th Brigade, pass through
the leading Brigades on the "C" line and attack the "D"
line from D 8 to D 9; then to extend its left to D 11.
General Withycombe disposed the 10th and 9th Rifles in
first line, the former with its right on D 8, the latter with
its left on D 9. After the capture of this objective, the 9th
Rifles were to extend to D 10 and the 10th to D 9. The
8th Rifles, moving up in rear, were to occupy and hold
from D 10 to D 11.</p>

<p>The assaulting battalions were to advance, each in eight
successive waves, at fifty yards' interval, but the 107th
Brigade, passing through to the attack on the final objective,
was to advance in artillery formation till compelled to
extend.</p>

<p>The artillery consisted of the 36th Divisional Artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one Brigade of the 49th Division, a Regiment of French
Artillery, and, under the orders of the X. Corps, a greater
concentration of heavy artillery than had been made in the
course of the war till now, except perhaps in the latter stages
of Verdun. The preliminary bombardment was to last five
days, from the 24th to the 28th of June. Owing to wet
weather the attack was postponed two days, and there were
two extra days of bombardment. The results, as witnessed
from our observation posts, were magnificent. All wire that
could be seen was effectively cut. As one watched the big
shells bursting, sending up huge columns of earth, day
after day, it appeared as though no life could continue in
that tortured and blasted area. The barrage for the attack
was not the true "creeping barrage" which was to become
universal later on, and was, indeed, employed that day by
the French. After a final intensive bombardment of sixty-five
minutes, it fired upon each German line in succession,
lifting from the "A" to the "A.I." at Zero, from the
"A.I." at Zero plus three minutes, from the "B" at Zero
plus eighteen minutes, to a line 400 yards east of this objective.
Then at Zero plus twenty-eight minutes it moved
on to the "C" line, and at Zero plus one hour eighteen
minutes off the "C" line to the "D." There was then
a long halt to permit of the passing through of the 107th
Brigade. At Zero plus two hours thirty-eight minutes the
barrage moved up to a line three hundred yards east of the
"D" line. At each lift, sections of 18-pounders and 4.5
howitzers "walked up" the communication trenches to the
next barrage line. Stokes mortars were to take part in a
final hurricane bombardment prior to Zero, while medium<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and heavy mortars were also employed, the former on
special points, the latter moving with the artillery barrage
to the extremity of their range. The French artillery
joined in the preliminary wire-cutting, using high explosive
instead of shrapnel according to its custom, but its main
task was the drenching of the Ancre valley with gas shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Two machine-guns were to accompany each battalion in
the attack, the remaining eight of each Machine-Gun Company
being in Brigade Reserve. Guns were allotted to all
the principal strong points that were to be consolidated.
Eighteen Stokes mortars were to go forward, the personnel
of the remaining eighteen acting as carriers. Two sections
of the 150th Field Company were allotted to the 109th
Brigade, and one section of the 122nd Field Company to
the 108th Brigade on each bank of the Ancre. The remainder
of the Field Companies were in Divisional Reserve.</p>

<p>The medical arrangements were of peculiar difficulty,
particularly on the southern part of the front. The two
Main Dressing Stations, for stretcher cases and "walking
wounded" respectively, were at Forceville, manned by the
108th Field Ambulance, and Clairfaye Farm, further west,
manned by the 110th Field Ambulance. The Advanced
Dressing Station was situated close to the Albert-Arras
Road in Aveluy Wood. Evacuation of wounded from the
Regimental Aid Posts in Thiepval Wood and Authuille had
to take place over Authuille Bridge, or by the trench tramway
which crossed the Ancre to the north of it. The motors
of the Field Ambulance were parked on the Martinsart-Albert
Road, south of the former village. For "walking
wounded" there was a collecting station west of Martinsart,
whence horsed wagons carried them by a cross-country
track through Hédauville to Clairfaye. From Hamel evacuation
was simpler, though even here it had to follow a
specially dug trench from the village to a point where the
Hamel-Albert Road was screened from observation.</p>

<p>On the 22nd and 23rd the infantry took up the positions
it was to occupy during the bombardment; the 9th Inniskillings
in the right section of Thiepval Wood, the 11th
Rifles in the left, and the 9th Irish Fusiliers in the Hamel
trenches. These troops had a purgatory to endure. For
the most part in the narrow slit assembly trenches, with
the rain pouring steadily down upon them, they were under
furious German bombardments that wreathed the wood in
smoke and flame, and made the crashing of great trees the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
accompaniment to the roar of bursting shells. On the
night of the 26th gas was liberated by us from cylinders
in the wood after a great bombardment. It was the first
time the Division had had to do with the abominable stuff,
which brought no good fortune. Many cylinders were
burst by the heavy German barrage, and serious casualties
suffered by the men of the Special Brigade responsible for
opening the cocks, and by the infantry assisting them.</p>

<p>Two hours later a raid was carried out in this sector by
a party sent up by the 13th Rifles. The men, now at a
pitch of excitement and enthusiasm that rendered them
resistless opponents in hand-to-hand fighting, swarmed into
the battered German trenches, shooting right and left, and
bombing dug-outs. They returned with one German
officer and twelve other ranks as prisoners, the first captured
by the 36th Division. Their own casualties were six
killed and nine wounded, suffered for the most part in the
Sunken Road, where, like the 9th Inniskillings, they had to
lie for some time ere it was possible to return to their trenches.
Captain Johnston, the leader of the raid, brought in all
his casualties, as well as his prisoners. He was to fall five
days later in the greater venture. The prisoners denied
knowledge of our gas, nor did their respirators smell of it.
It was occasionally the experience of the Division that the
British gas services rated too highly the effects of their
devices.</p>

<p>On the 27th, "X" day, it rained in sheets, and "Y"
day was little better. It was accordingly decided by the
Higher Command to postpone the attack for two days. This
necessitated a postponement of the assembly also. Instead,
inter-brigade reliefs were carried out in the trenches to
give some rest to the troops that had endured the early
hammering. Their rest, unfortunately, was in huts in
Martinsart Wood, huts that trembled and creaked to the
terrific roar of siege howitzers firing night and day beside
them. Yet it was better than that other wood across the
river, which was the following day, now "Y.1" day, visited
by the heaviest bombardment yet seen. The trenches were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in a terrible state, and the men of the medium trench mortar
batteries, engaged in cutting the German wire, suffered
more even than the infantry, and earned the admiration of
the latter by their devotion to their task.</p>

<p>In all the circumstances it must be said that the total
casualties for the month of June, approximately seven hundred
and fifty, were not heavy. They included the results
of a veritable calamity that befell the 13th Rifles. On the
evening of the 28th, "Y" day, the battalion was relieving
the 11th Rifles in Thiepval Wood, and marching out of
Martinsart by platoons at two hundred yards' interval. As
number 11 Platoon and battalion headquarters were about
to march out together a shell fell right in the midst of the
party. Fourteen were killed on the spot, and ten more
died later. Almost all the rest were wounded, including
the second-in-command, Major R. P. Maxwell, and the
adjutant, Captain Wright. The confusion in the pitch
darkness, with scarce a man on his feet, was appalling.
Fortunately a platoon of the 11th Rifles, just relieved from
the trenches, appeared on the scene, and the street was
speedily cleared. But the Germans could have had far
bigger hauls than this at "Lancashire Dump" on the Albert-Hamel
Road in Aveluy Wood any night they had chosen
to shell it.</p>

<p>This was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i> of a mass of transport immediately
after dusk, bringing up munitions and rations for the
offensive. Large stores of the latter were placed in specially
constructed dug-outs on the river bank. The work of the
Divisional Train was here most admirably organized by its
commander, Colonel Bernard. So close were the big
convoys to the German trenches that extraordinary precautions
to avoid noise had to be taken. Wheels were
bound with straw and old motor tyres, steel chains replaced
by leather straps, boots, like those used in rolling a cricket
ground, placed over the horses' hoofs. And it was an
amusing sight to see an A.S.C. driver frantically clinging
to the nose of some sociable horse that desired to greet
new acquaintances with a friendly neigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The reward of waiting came in a fine day on "Y.2"
day, the 30th. Divisional Headquarters moved up to
their report centre on the Englebelmer-Martinsart Road.
At night the approach march took place, and assaulting
battalions returned to their positions in the trenches. The
assembly positions of the 107th Brigade (less 15th Rifles)
were in slit trenches in Aveluy Wood. The battalions
marched up by cross-country tracks, marked, one by red
lanterns, the other by green. The night was fine, and the
artillery on either side rather less active, though lachrymatory
shell was falling in the wood. In a curious complete
lull that fell before dawn, men heard with astonishment a
nightingale burst into song, pouring out her bubbling notes
one upon the other, as though this had been still the pleasant
copse, deserted by man, but a kingdom of the birds, of
two years gone.</p>

<p>The two days' postponement had had upon the men an
effect contrary to that which might have been attended.
The extra strain of waiting was more than counterbalanced
by the coincidence of the date. For it was upon July the 1st,
the anniversary of the Boyne, that the sons of the victors
in that battle, after eight generations, fought this greater
fight. To them it had a very special significance. A
stirring in their blood bore witness to the silent call of their
ancestors. There seemed to them a predestination in the
affair. They spoke of it as they waited, during the final
intensive bombardment, while the German counter-barrage
rained upon their trenches.</p>

<p>Day had dawned clear and sunny. Zero was at 7-30
a.m., when it had been light for four hours. Far better
had it been had the conventional dawn attack been carried
out. However, the first movements were concealed by the
intensity of our fire, and by smoke barrages put down by
4-inch Stokes mortars in the valley of the Ancre and in
front of Thiepval village. The troops formed up in "No
Man's Land," facing their objectives, following for the most
part, on the left bank of the Ancre, the line of the sunken
Thiepval-Hamel Road. At 7-15 a.m. the leading companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
issued from the gaps cut in our wire, extended to two paces'
interval, and moved forward to within one hundred and
fifty yards of the German trench. The hubbub of the
British bombardment was terrific; over their heads the
Stokes mortars, firing at highest rate, were slinging a hundred
shells into the air at once.</p>

<p>Zero! The hurricane Stokes bombardment ceased.
The artillery lifted off the first line. The whistles of the
officers sounded, and the men sprang up and advanced at
steady marching pace on the German trenches. Those who
saw those leading battalions move to the assault, above all
their commanding officers, forbidden to accompany them,
who waved to them from the parapet, received one of the
most powerful and enduring impressions of their lives.
Colonel Macrory of the 10th Inniskillings speaks of "lines
of men moving forward, with rifles sloped and the sun
glistening upon their fixed bayonets, keeping their alignment
and distance as well as if on a ceremonial parade,
unfaltering, unwavering." General Ricardo, then commanding
the 9th Inniskillings, wrote a few days later: "I stood
on the parapet between the two centre exits to wish them
luck.... They got going without delay; no fuss, no
shouting, no running, everything solid and thorough&mdash;just
like the men themselves. Here and there a boy would
wave his hand to me as I shouted good luck to them through
my megaphone. And all had a cheery face. Most were
carrying loads. Fancy advancing against heavy fire with
a big roll of barbed wire on your shoulder!" So they
bore upon the German lines, while behind them, from
Thiepval Wood, rocked by exploding shells, sheeted in the
smoke and flame of bursting shrapnel, fresh troops issued
and followed upon their advance in little columns.</p>

<p>It is the custom, kept throughout this History, to describe
the course of battles from the right hand to the left.
If here it is departed from, it is only because the action on
the north side of the Ancre was separate from the other
and of lesser importance. Its description, alas! will
occupy small space enough. There was here in "No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Man's Land" a deep ravine, which the map contours show
without giving an idea of its abruptness. The first wave
of the 9th Irish Fusiliers reached this with little trouble,
but those which followed met with very heavy machine-gun
fire, and suffered terrible loss. Advancing at Zero with
splendid dash, the survivors of a battalion which Colonel
Blacker's training had made one of the best in the Division,
swept through the enemy's front line trenches. One
small body of the right centre company in particular carried
all before it, and was last seen advancing upon Beaucourt
Station. On the left the 12th Rifles had worse fortune.
The wire round the German salient over the hill-brow, less
easy to observe, was less completely destroyed than on the
rest of the front. Many gaps were cut, but machine-guns
were trained upon them. Beaten back at the first rush,
and having lost the barrage, the remnants of the battalion
were twice re-formed by devoted officers under that withering
hail, and twice again led forward. It was of no avail. On
their left the leading troops of the next Division crossed
the front line trenches, but were assailed from the rear by
machine-gunners emerging from dug-outs. At eight o'clock
the 36th Division was informed that the enemy had retaken
his front line. The attack north of the Ancre was
a failure, though gallantry every whit as great as that of
the battalions on the left bank was behind it.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, for all its losses, the attack was a complete
success. Every objective was reached. Had it been possible
to attain the same results all along the front, the day
would have ended with the greatest British victory of the war.</p>

<p>The leading waves, still moving as on parade, reached
the German front line trench and moved straight across it.
They did not suffer heavily. Hardly were they across,
however, when the German barrage fell upon "No Man's
Land," upon the rear companies of the first line battalions,
and upon those of the second line. And immediately the
barrage left it, flanking machine-gun fire burst out from the
dominating position of Thiepval cemetery. The 11th Inniskillings
and 14th Rifles, as they emerged from the wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
were literally mown down, and "No Man's Land" became
a ghastly spectacle of dead and wounded. On the left of
the line the 13th Rifles, under long-range fire from the
Beaucourt Redoubt across the river, suffered at this stage
most heavily of all. They had lost the bulk of their officers
ere ever they reached the German trenches. The Division
on the right was never able to clear Thiepval village, and
it was that fact which was responsible for the gravest losses
of the 36th.</p>

<p>Under this deadly punishment the men never hesitated.
They went straight forward across the first two lines, sending
back the few prisoners they took. The "B" line was
to be reached at 7-48. Despite the gaps in their ranks the
first wave swept upon it at precisely that moment. There
was not much fighting here, but a large number of prisoners
was taken, the German infantry surrendering as our men
came upon them. The 15th Rifles, the supporting battalion
of the 108th Brigade's attack, had, however, to deal
with some Germans who came up out of unnoticed dug-outs
after the leading battalions had crossed the "A" lines,
the bombing squads told off to clear the trenches having
been destroyed by machine-gun fire. On pressed the
leading waves. Never losing the barrage, they took the
"C" line, including the north-east corner of the Schwaben
Redoubt, at 8-48. Even in the trenches they suffered loss
from the flanking machine-guns, while movement from front
to rear was now all but impossible. The supporting battalions,
or their survivors, were also upon their objectives.
Every man had done what he was set to do, or dropped in
his path. And, to the eternal credit of our artillery, no man
appears to have needed his wire-cutters.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the 107th Brigade, which had meanwhile
advanced to the "A" line. It had moved from Aveluy
Wood and across the Ancre to the western skirts of Thiepval
Wood, almost at the bottom of the valley, assembling
at 6-30 about the track known as Speyside. It had an
hour to wait, shell after shell passing just over the heads
of the troops and bursting in the marshes beyond them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
At Zero, led by the 10th Rifles, it moved back east for a
short distance, to reach the rides which were its paths to
the front line. Here the men could see the troops of the
Division on the right issuing from their trenches, and each
platoon, as it extended in "No Man's Land," disappearing
before the blast of machine-gun fire that met it. The ride
used by the 10th Rifles on the right had been denuded of
its foliage by the bombardments of several days, and was
in view. The battalion came under machine-gun fire from
front, right, and right <em>rear</em> simultaneously. The commanding
officer, Colonel Bernard, was killed, and casualties
were high. The final passage had to be carried out by
rushes to the front line. The leading men could even see
the German machine-guns firing at them, so that it is easy
to imagine what sort of target they offered to those guns.
Lewis guns were brought forward to engage them, but
their teams were destroyed. The other battalions suffered
considerably less, being screened in their rides, and further
from the Thiepval guns. Before ten o'clock, runners, with
the skill and devotion of their kind, had come back to report
that the "C" line had been reached. Eight minutes
past, it may be remembered, was the hour for the assault
upon the "D" line.</p>

<p>To General Nugent it had appeared long before probable
that his troops, if they went forward further as a wedge
into the enemy's defensive system, with not a yard gained
on either flank, would go only to their own destruction.
At 8-32 his G.S.O.1., Colonel Place, had asked the X. Corps
whether the 107th Brigade might be stopped from advancing
upon the last line. The reply was that a new attack was
being made on Thiepval, and also by the VIII. Corps north
of the Ancre, and that the 107th Brigade must do its part
by continuing its advance. But three-quarters of an hour
later, at 9-16 a.m., instructions from the Corps to withhold
the 107th Brigade till the situation upon the flanks
had been cleared up were received. General Withycombe
was ordered to stop his troops, and employed every means
in his power to do so. But all the telephone lines taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
forward had been cut by German fire, while for a runner
to reach the line now held by the troops was a very long
affair. Fortunate was he if he crossed that zone of death
without scathe. The message arrived too late; the troops
were committed to the attack. With them went forward
some men of the other Brigades.</p>

<p>Of that last wild and desperate venture across a thousand
yards of open country, few returned to tell the tale. Those
that did tell of an entry into that last entrenchment, of
desperate hand-to-hand fighting, and then, when the odds
were too great, for the trench was full of German reserves,
of a stubborn retirement to the next line. And now the
German bombers surged up the trenches from St. Pierre
Divion, to be beaten off again and again by the 8th and
15th Rifles, and the handful of the 13th remaining on that
flank. Pressure on the other side did not come so soon:
in fact, Lieutenant Sanderson, of the 9th Rifles, reconnoitred
the trench "Mouquet Switch," on the front of the
32nd Division, and found it unoccupied. But Thiepval's
machine-guns were still firing, and "No Man's Land" was
a land of death. Two companies of the Pioneers were
sent up to dig a communication trench across, which would
have permitted the sending up of bombs and water. But
at two o'clock Colonel Leader, their commanding officer,
reported that the machine-gun fire rendered the task impossible.
Supplies had run out, and the little parties that
strove to bear them across were annihilated by fire. After
noon attacks came upon the right flank also, the 11th Inniskillings
at the Crucifix, and the 9th in the Schwaben Redoubt,
being hard beset. The French artillery was ordered
to put down a flank barrage on the right, and carried out
its task admirably.</p>

<p>The 146th Brigade of the 49th Division had crossed the
Ancre during the morning. At three p.m. it received
orders to attack Thiepval village under a barrage, after an
intense bombardment. The attack failed completely under
terrific machine-gun fire. It was, in fact, stopped after the
leading battalion, the 1/6th West Yorks, had seen the platoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which strove to deploy wither away. It was about this
time that the Germans launched a counter-attack in the
open on the left flank. Two companies emerged from the
trees of the river valley and advanced on C 11. Caught on
the hill by our artillery and the Lewis guns of the 8th Rifles,
they were destroyed. There was a grave misunderstanding
about the employment of the 146th Brigade. At four
o'clock the 36th Division was informed that it was at its
disposal. General Withycombe, the senior Brigadier in
Thiepval Wood, was ordered to send two of its battalions
to the Schwaben Redoubt, to rally the troops beginning to
be forced back. But two battalions of the Brigade were
already committed to the attack on Thiepval, while the two
others had moved up behind them into the trenches of the
32nd Division. Not till 7-18 did six companies move up
towards the "C" line, and now it was too late. On this
flank it was already lost, and the Yorkshiremen were beaten
off by German machine-gun fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the situation had grown desperate. Major
Peacocke, second-in-command of the 9th Inniskillings, had
managed to cross "No Man's Land" at noon into the front
line about A 12, and after beating off attacks by Germans
bombing their way up from Thiepval, collected a little
bodyguard and worked forward to the Crucifix. He speedily
discovered that the holding of the ground here, now slipping
from our hands, was an impossibility unless Thiepval
were taken. The men were still determined, but at their
last gasp from fatigue. There was scarcely any ammunition
or water for the Vickers guns, and it was all but impossible
to send it up. A similar report was brought to General
Griffith by Major Blair Oliphant, second-in-command of the
11th Rifles, who carried out an admirable reconnaissance.
A final counter-attack, launched in the dusk by fresh troops
that had come into Grandcourt by train during the evening,
drove our men in from the "B" line. By ten o'clock it
did not appear that we had any troops in the German lines.
That which had been won at a sacrifice so vast, had been
lost for lack of support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Fresh troops for a further attack on Thiepval were put
at the disposal of the 36th Division in the middle of the
night. General Withycombe, at 11-30 p.m., received the
4th York and Lancs, of the 148th Brigade, with the intimation
that the 4th and 5th K.O.Y.L.I.'s of the same Brigade
would follow, to retake the Schwaben Redoubt, with
the assistance of the remnants of the 107th and 109th Brigades.
At one o'clock the latter battalions had not arrived.
General Withycombe made the following appreciation of
the position:</p>

<p>It was doubtful if it would be possible to organize an
attack before daylight. This was a vital consideration, since
an advance by daylight would be swept by fire from Thiepval,
which was not being attacked that night, and the inevitable
result would be a repetition of the previous day's
experiences.</p>

<p>If the troops did succeed in moving off before dawn, it
would be almost impossible for them to keep direction in
the darkness, on ground they did not know.</p>

<p>Lastly, General Withycombe submitted that, if the
Schwaben Redoubt were taken, it could not be held while
Thiepval was still in German occupation.</p>

<p>General Nugent was fully in accord with these views.
He submitted the matter to the Corps Commander, who
replied that in such a case the man on the spot must decide.
The proposed operation was therefore cancelled, and General
Withycombe sent the 4th and 5th K.O.Y.L.I.'s to Aveluy
Wood, retaining under his hand the 4th York and Lancs,
in case of emergency.</p>

<p>At seven a.m. next morning, as sun dispersed the first
summer ground-mist, observers on the Mesnil Ridge saw
that there were yet British troops in small numbers in
the first two lines of German trenches. General Nugent
ordered General Withycombe to support and reinforce these
troops, and to send forward supplies of bombs, ammunition,
and water. General Withycombe collected a force of four
hundred men of the four battalions of his own Brigade,
together with two guns of the 107th Machine-Gun Company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Under the command of Major Woods, of the 9th
Rifles, this devoted band moved across "No Man's Land"
at two o'clock in artillery formation. It lost a third of its
numbers from the enemy's fire, but it reached its objectives.
Two small parties of the 16th Rifles (Pioneers), with bombs
and ammunition, crossed later in the afternoon, going
through the German barrage in most gallant fashion. On
the left flank Major Woods found Corporal Sanders, of the
7th West Yorks, with a party of forty men, whom he described
as "played out, but full of fight." He had been
beating off German bombing attacks all night, had rescued
several wounded Ulstermen, and taken a number of
prisoners. This stout-hearted N.C.O. was subsequently
awarded the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>That night the 36th Division was relieved by the 49th.
The 148th Brigade relieved the 107th in the two lines of
trenches now held, between A 12 and A 19. The relief
was not complete till after ten o'clock the following morning,
when a weary, tattered, pitiful remnant marched into
Martinsart and flung themselves down to sleep. They had
brought back to Thiepval Wood fourteen prisoners. The
total number captured by the 36th Division in the offensive
was five hundred and forty-three. Its casualties in the two
days amounted to five thousand five hundred officers and
other ranks killed, wounded, and missing. The whole
Province was thrown into mourning for its sons. Among
the dead were Colonel H. C. Bernard, of the 10th Rifles;
Major G. H. Gaffiken, of the 9th, who had led his
company to the final objective; Lieutenant G. St. G. S.
Cather, Adjutant of the 9th Irish Fusiliers, awarded a posthumous
Victoria Cross for his services in bringing in
wounded under machine-gun fire, in the course of which
he lost his life; Captain E. N. F. Bell, 9th Inniskillings,
attached 109th Trench Mortar Battery, who likewise had
bestowed on him that last honour. Captain Charles Craig,
M.P. for South Antrim, was wounded and taken prisoner.
Some battalions had almost disappeared. The 9th Irish
Fusiliers, for example, had at the end of the first day none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the officers and only eighty other ranks left unwounded
of the force that took part in the attack. The figures of
the 8th Rifles, as of a battalion below rather than above
the average in casualties, may be given in full. Officers:
fifteen wounded, five missing. Other ranks: twenty-four
killed, two hundred and sixteen wounded, one hundred and
eighty-six missing. And of the "missing," it must be recorded
that three-fourths at least were in reality dead,
somewhere out in front of the line finally handed over.</p>

<p>Of the deeds of heroism that day accomplished, it is
not possible to enumerate one-hundredth. Notable among
them were the achievements of junior officers and N.C.O.'s
when their seniors had fallen. Lieutenant H. Gallagher,
11th Inniskillings, was the sole officer of his battalion to cross
the German front line. With his orderly's rifle he killed
six Germans holding up the advance, and then, at the
Crucifix, organized the resistance, being one of the last to
quit the German trenches at night. Lieutenant Sir Harry
Macnaghten, 12th Rifles, twice reformed the tatters of his
company in "No Man's Land," and led them against gaps
in the German wire, to fall himself on the second occasion.
Corporal John Conn, 9th Inniskillings, came upon two of
our machine-guns out of action. He repaired one under
fire and annihilated a German flanking party. He carried
both guns himself most of the way back, but had to abandon
one at last owing to utter exhaustion. These are but
examples, picked at random. Another very remarkable
Victoria Cross was that won by Private Quigg, 12th Rifles,
Sir Harry Macnaghten's servant. He had, on July the 1st,
advanced thrice to the attack. Next morning he heard a
rumour that his officer was out wounded in "No Man's
Land." Seven times he went out to look for him, and
seven times he brought in a wounded man, the last dragged
on a waterproof sheet from within a few yards of the German
wire.</p>

<p>All arms had supported the infantry finely in their great,
heroic achievement. The work of the artillery could not
have been bettered. It carried out its long and gruelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
task to perfection. Even in front of the "D" line the wire
was well cut. One forward battery of the 172nd Brigade
in Hamel, in full view of the enemy, enfiladed his lines
across the Ancre, doing great execution and being handled
with extreme gallantry. The Engineers suffered very heavy
casualties in their devotion to duty, working in the marsh
at keeping repaired the vital pipe-lines, regardless of the
shells that all day fell about them. The stretcher-bearers
of the R.A.M.C. were tireless. Often, owing to break-down
on the trench tramway due to shell-fire, they had to carry
wounded right down from Thiepval Wood and across the
Ancre at Authuille. Many dropped from sheer exhaustion,
and many refused to rest when reliefs arrived. The Army
Service Corps drivers of the ambulances kept their cars
continuously on the roads for thirty-six hours. There was
throughout no hitch in the medical arrangements, though
at one period of the day the overcrowding of the Main
Dressing Station at Forceville, due to the strain upon the
Motor Ambulance Convoy which evacuated the wounded
to the Casualty Clearing Stations, gave rise to much anxiety.</p>

<p>A volume might be written&mdash;the extent of many a volume
probably has&mdash;upon the causes of the failure, for such the
whole northern section of the attack undoubtedly was.
This is not the place for a detailed discussion of them. It
may at least be said that, while the work of the artillery
could not have been excelled, the whole scheme of its employment
had not reached anything approaching the science
of the following year. Artillerymen of the higher ranks
were to some extent carried away by the weight of metal
for the first time at their disposal, and carried away other
arms by their new enthusiasm. The heavy gunners believed
and proclaimed that no life could endure their fire,
and that the battle would resolve itself into an advance by
the infantry to take over shattered and undefended trenches.
They had not realized that the machine-guns would be
comparatively safe under their bombardment, and that it
would take but a few seconds to bring them into action
when the barrage was past. It is probable that at a later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stage of the war a fortress such as Thiepval would not have
been attacked directly by infantry till it had been first encircled
and isolated by its advance, being kept the while
under such artillery fire as would have forced the machine-gunners
to lie low, and then rushed from all sides by bombing
parties. It may be said that our organization at the
beginning of the Somme Offensive was in a transitional
stage. We had realized that defence with the machine-gun
had beaten attack, and had begun the process of increasing
the quantity and improving the quality of mechanical accessories.
It was still, however, to cost thousands of lives
before the factories could produce sufficient of the latter,
or the higher commands reach the ratio between infantry
force and mechanical aids necessary to the prosecution of
a given operation. But no explanations that can be found
stand without ample tribute to the fighting qualities of the
German soldier. The dash and bravery of the counter-attacks
of the bombers moving up from the valley merit
high praise. The highest, however, must be reserved for
the machine-gunners, who had sat for days in their dug-outs
without fresh food, the very earth shaking to the thunders
of our artillery, and then came up and brought their
guns into action at the right moment.</p>

<p>On July the 5th the Division moved back to Rubempré
and the neighbouring villages, and five days later to the
Bernaville area. The Artillery remained in line under the
orders of the 49th Division, while the Pioneers, 121st and
122nd Field Companies, were left several days at work, the
former having, amongst other unpleasant tasks, to make
a communication trench across "No Man's Land" to the
new-won ground.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The 150th Field Company had a yet
harder time. It was sent to the 12th Division, further
south, in the neighbourhood of Ovillers, where a slight
advance had been made. Its work here was the consolidation
of strong points, "before they were taken," as its
commander, Major Boyle, remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Orders came at Bernaville for a move to Flanders. The
Engineers, relieved of their task, marched north. The rest
of the Division, less the Artillery, was moved by train from
Auxi-le-Château, Frévent, and Conteville, to Berguette,
Thiennes, and Steenbecque, between Aire and Hazebrouck,
on its way to the training area west of St. Omer. The
infantry battalions were but shadows of their former selves.
Well might commanding officers feel appalled at the magnitude
of the task before them in building up anew, without
the best of their officers and N.C.O.'s. The men were
very silent in these first few days after the battle. Not one
of the survivors but had lost companions who had been
two years at his side; many, friends of a lifetime. But if
ever gift be God-given, it is the healing effect of time. And
in days of war a week even is a long period. These men,
moreover, felt that in all that had happened there was no
reproach for them. They, at least, had accomplished
their task in the face of incredible difficulties. On the 12th
of July, General Nugent and his Staff saw the battalions of
the 107th Brigade marching from the station of Thiennes
into Blaringhem. Sun was shining on the old Flemish
village. Officers and men wore marigolds in caps to honour
the day; the bands played "King William's March."
The least practised eye could tell that to these men confidence
was returning; that the worst of the horror they
had endured had been shaken from their shoulders. They
marched like victors, as was their right.</p>

<span class="smcap">From the Somme to Messines: July 1916 to June 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">On July the 13th the Division moved into the well-known
training area west of St. Omer, with headquarters at Tilques.
Those of the 107th Brigade were at Bayenghem, of the
108th at Eperlecques, and of the 109th at Boisdinghem.
Here training and reorganization began, and here reinforcements
arrived in considerable numbers.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Five days
later the Artillery, which had remained in line covering the
49th Division, rejoined, having moved north by march
route. R.A. Headquarters were established at the château
at Recques. The troops were much refreshed by this return
to civilization, and units had leisure to absorb their
drafts. Unfortunately it did not last very long. On July
the 20th Headquarters moved to Esquelbecq, to a famous
and beautiful moated château, that bore at the door rings
to which Marlborough's troopers had tied their reins, and
had been occupied by General Grant after Waterloo.
Meanwhile the 108th Brigade moved forward, by 'bus and
lorry, to Kortepyp Camp, south of the village of Neuve
Eglise, and Red Lodge, on the southern slopes of Hill 63,
and west of the famous Bois de Ploegsteert, that will go
down to Britons for all time as "Plug Street Wood." On
the 23rd Headquarters moved to the château on Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Noir, a couple of miles north of Bailleul, and that night
the 108th Brigade re-entered the line in relief of two battalions
of the 20th Division. By the end of July the 109th
Brigade had come in on the right, in relief of troops of
the 41st Division, and the 107th had relieved the 108th
Brigade. The front line now held ran from a ruin on the
Neuve Eglise-Warneton Road, known as Anton's Farm, on
the right, to another known as Boyle's Farm on the Wulverghem-Messines
Road, on the left. The frontage was some
three thousand yards in a straight line, but there were over
two and a half miles of front-line trench. On September the
1st the headquarters of the Division moved from Mont
Noir to the village of St. Jans Cappel, near Bailleul.</p>

<p>The Division was to remain for upwards of a year in
this part of the line, but it seldom held precisely the same
section of front for more than a few weeks at a time. The
various moves cannot be treated in detail. There were
changes in August, all three Brigades entering the line, and
early in September a "side-step" to the north, the right
boundary now being the River Douve, and the left "Piccadilly
Trench," south of the Kemmel-Wytschaete Road.
The 108th Brigade was now on the right, the 107th in the
centre, and the 109th on the left. The characteristics of
the various parts of all this front were similar, the conditions
of the soil the same throughout, so that a general
description will hold good for all the period passed by the
Division in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The trenches and dug-outs, to begin with, were not
such at all in the sense in which the troops had been wont
to use the names on the Ancre. The fighting trenches consisted,
everywhere save on the highest ground, of parapets
built of sandbags filled with clay. In places there was a
parados similarly constructed, but over long stretches the
men in the front line simply stood behind the wall, with
no protection against the back-burst of shells. Water in
this country appeared everywhere just below the surface,
and it was useless to dig trenches in the real sense for any
purpose other than drainage. Even the communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
trenches were sunk not deeper than a foot, and piled high
on either side with earth, which made them satisfactory
enough as cover from view, but very vulnerable to shell-fire.
These communication trenches were longer than
those to which the troops had been accustomed, the approaches
to the front line being much more exposed than
among the folds of the Somme country. As for dug-outs,
there were none. Little wooden-framed shelves in the parapet,
a few "baby elephants"&mdash;arched steel shelters, which,
if covered thickly enough with sandbags, afforded protection
against the shells of field guns&mdash;served for the troops in
line, while further back, for battalion headquarters and
forts, there were ruined farms, which often had good cellars,
and in the frame-work of which concrete structures could
be hidden. It was hard for troops used to the Somme
chalk to accustom their minds to the spongy nature of this
soil. In the dry weeks of August, for example, the R.E.
built one very fine dug-out, twenty feet deep, and were
proud of their handiwork. In September there was in it
a foot of water, in October two; November found the
water level with the top of the stairs, and a sarcastic notice,
"The R.E. Swimming Bath," at the entrance.</p>

<p>When it rained, which was not seldom, all the low-lying
ground flooded. The valley of the Douve, above all,
from Wulverghem to the front line, became a muddy swamp,
in which the water lay in sheets. At such times, and indeed
during a great part of the winter, many trenches simply
could not be occupied. No adequate idea of the impression
conveyed upon the mind of a man coming up north from
the clean, white trenches of the Somme can be obtained
of all this area unless it is conceived as dirty, mournful,
and disconsolate; haunted by the evil stench of blue clay,
and brooded over by an atmosphere of decay.</p>

<p>Since the days of the first Battle of Ypres and of the
rival turning movements which had ended in the present
deadlock, the Germans had had the best of the ground in
the Messines sector. Behind the salient of their front
trenches it rose sharply, with a dip half-way up, formed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the shallow valley of the Steenebeek, to a dominating ridge,
crowned south and north by the fortress-villages of Messines
and Wytschaete. The road joining these was the limit of
our observation, except for telescopes on Kemmel Hill.
To the south we had a fair observation point in Hill 63,
but the one great boon granted to us was Kemmel. Had
it been a thousand yards nearer the front line, it would
have done much to counteract the advantage of the Messines-Wytschaete
Ridge. It is scarcely necessary to add that the
enemy had, in his long possession of the ridge, fortified
it with all his wonted industry and art. It was protected
by four general lines of well wired trenches west of the
road, and peppered over with little forts, wired all round,
the garrisons of which were provided with concrete structures,
miniature houses rather than dug-outs, proof against
anything up to an eight-inch shell.</p>

<p>General Plumer's Second Army was at this time playing
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of Cinderella among the British forces. Its front
was lightly held, even at Ypres, which had grown strangely
quiet of late. Certain preparations had been made for an
offensive in the summer, but had been largely abandoned
for lack of labour. The Army Commander, however,
insisted on pushing on his mining, in which he had great
faith, a faith amply to be justified the following year.
Throughout the winter and spring the Division furnished
large parties for work under the various Tunnelling Companies
in the shafts that were being driven under "No
Man's Land," and beneath the strongest portions of the
enemy's front line. The German miners were skilful
enough, and on other parts of the front often gave rather
more than they got, but here, from first to last, they were
out-manœuvred and out-fought in an underground war.
A striking instance of this was at La Petite Douve Farm,
on the Ploegsteert-Messines Road, where the British tunnellers
succeeded in pumping a fair proportion of the muddy
Douve into the Germans' shaft, whence they could be
heard, night after night, frantically ejecting it with a motor-pump.
One "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camouflet</span>," as a defensive explosion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
called, did indeed blow in our gallery here and undo months
of work, but the enemy probably did not know what he
had achieved, and the temporary check availed him nothing
in the end. No Ulsterman who served in Flanders in that
winter and the following spring will forget the skill, patience,
and absolute contempt for danger displayed by those tunnellers.
The 171st Tunnelling Company, with which the
Division was most closely associated, will be remembered
with particular affection and admiration.</p>

<p>The Second Army has been called the Cinderella of
our forces. Not only was it holding a long line lightly,
and with few reserves, but the main flow of ammunition
and material passed it by and went down to the Somme,
where the British were creeping forward in desperate fighting
to Bapaume. There were weeks in August and September
when the allowance of shells dropped to two and
even one round per 18-pounder a day, with heavier
calibres proportionately rationed.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The Germans were in
this respect similarly situated. Their ammunition also was
wanted on the Somme to put down those eternal barrages
with which they opposed our assaults. When the Division
first arrived in Flanders the artillery shell-fire was very
light indeed. That of the trench mortars did a good deal
to replace it. The Germans had concentrated on these
weapons as their chief means of offence, and, possessing
the advantage of the ground, they used them cleverly and
with great effect. With that curious regularity that appeared
to form part of the German mentality their bombardments
generally took place almost precisely at 3-30 p.m.
They were particularly severe in the neighbourhood of the
Spanbroek salient.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "In this sector," writes a machine-gun
officer, "I have seen five or six large 'minnies' in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>air at one time&mdash;really fearsome things. You could see
the fuses of the bombs alight in the air and follow their
flight most of the way, only to lose it when straight overhead;
and then there was nothing to do but wonder where
it would fall!" These long aerial torpedoes exploded with
shattering effect and made huge craters. It is useless to
disguise the fact that, during the first few weeks of the Division's
acquaintance with these trenches, the enemy had an
ascendancy in trench-mortar warfare. That ascendancy had
to be fought down. In the first place the German mortars,
or rather their emplacements, were carefully marked down
from observations taken in the line, and by the study of
aeroplane photographs. Maps were then issued by the staff,
upon which each active emplacement was shown by name.
The names began with the letter of the map square; all
in the "S" squares with S, and in the "U" squares with
U. The names chosen were generally feminine&mdash;doubtless
without ironic intention. A certain number of the emplacements
were allotted to each howitzer battery of the Divisional
Artillery, and also to such 6-inch howitzer batteries
of the Corps Heavy Artillery as were available. When
the mortar opened fire, all that was necessary was for
the words "Susie active," or "Ursula active," to be
wired back to the batteries. Susie, or Ursula, as the
case might be, was instantly engaged, while any machine-guns
that could be brought to bear upon her neighbourhood
also took a hand in the game. By this means it was
generally found possible to silence any individual mortar
in about a quarter of an hour at most, and to prevent it
from getting the exact range, and then knocking in a whole
section of trench at leisure.</p>

<p>On the British side, also, big trench-mortar bombardments,
aided by the Divisional Artillery, were periodically
arranged. In these affairs the leading <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> was played by
that terrific weapon, the heavy trench mortar, firing a projectile
of 180 lbs., and highly dramatic it not infrequently
was. One of these monsters dwelt at R.E. Farm, on the
Wulverghem-Wytschaete Road, and it was from this locality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that the principal "hates" were discharged. For perhaps
ten minutes the fire would continue, the "flying pig," as it
was called, sending over its giant shells, the medium mortars
firing their 60-lb. "plum puddings," and perhaps two batteries
of light Stokes mortars discharging twenty or
twenty-five rounds a minute from every gun. Meanwhile
the 18-pounders and howitzers behind joined in, while
machine-guns fired upon communication trenches. The
German retaliation was frequently heavy, and the teams of
the mortars, heavy, medium, and light, showed grim determination
in carrying out their tasks under punishment.
General Brock, the C.R.A., did not believe in sending to
the mortar batteries weaklings who were not wanted with
the guns, and these trench mortars acquired a peculiar
type of artillery officer,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> resolute, hard-bitten, perhaps often
careless and unconventional, but capable in great moments
of the most splendid courage, lightly worn and taken for
granted between comrade and comrade.</p>

<p>Few who have known anything of it can recall the
"flying pig" without a smile. There was a pleasing uncertainty
about this weapon. When the first round was fired
from R.E. Farm, the charge did not ignite properly, and
the big shell went forth, flaming gun-cotton marking its
path, to land three hundred yards away just behind the
British front line, making a huge crater and demolishing
the local company headquarters! Thereafter the propellent
was improved, but it was thought wiser temporarily to
evacuate the front line over which the mortar was firing.
It was typical of the infantryman's good humour that the
incident was greeted everywhere with laughter and treasured
as an excellent jest. War, indeed, has a curious effect upon
the sense of humour, and far grimmer pleasantries than
this were the subjects of mirth. When a IX. Corps intelligence
summary remarked that a German cemetery
behind the ridge "appeared to be filling nicely," it was
hailed as the joke of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
It was the aim of the Army Commander to harass by
all means in his power the troops that faced him, to prevent
divisions that were sent down to the Somme from going as
fresh troops, and to prevent those others that had been withdrawn
from the hell-broth from recovering too quickly and
easily from its effects. The intense bombardments with
trench artillery were but one weapon in this campaign.
Another, as autumn drew on and supplies of ammunition
came more freely to hand, was the shelling of approaches
and, above all, the railway terminus in Messines, by night.
But the principal weapon in this minor offensive was the
raiding party. So long as men who took part in the war
are alive, the subject of raids is like to crop up whenever
two or three are met together. But the conclusion of such
discussions is invariably the same. Raids were frequently
useful, and sometimes imperatively necessary; but the
British raided too often. Raids to obtain identification of
troops opposite, and even to keep the enemy "on the stretch,"
were justifiable; those with the object of raising the moral
of our troops were not, because they did not succeed in
their object. "No doubt," writes one of the Brigadiers of
the 36th Division who was responsible for many raids,
"no doubt a successful raid had a good effect in a unit,
but not always among the raiding party. The meticulous
preparation made the 'waiting-for-the-dentist' period hard
and trying. And the raiders were always picked men,
who in a battle were of inestimable value. Many units had
to deplore the loss of the very cream of their officers,
N.C.O.'s, and men in raids. And the cold-blooded courage
demanded of all concerned took heavy toll of the nervous
energy of even the biggest thruster." The Higher Command,
also, often called for raids immediately troops had taken
over a line, before they had learnt their way about in "No
Man's Land" by dint of patrolling, and before they had
recovered from the effects of an attack delivered on some
other part of the front.</p>

<p>The record of the 36th Division with regard to raids
was from first to last a very high one. The failures were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
few in comparison with the successes. It was also the case
that, while the troops of the Division carried out a great
number of successful raids, the number of occasions on
which they themselves failed to repulse German raids or
lost prisoners to the raiders can be numbered on the fingers
of both hands. In the eleven months between the opening
of the Somme Offensive and the Battle of Messines, the
Division carried out over a dozen raids; but the first hand-to-hand
encounter with the enemy took place, not in his
trenches, but in "No Man's Land." It is a curious little
episode, and deserves to be treated at some length.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that only a short time before the
Somme Battle was the efficacy of the German apparatus
for overhearing telephone conversation realized by the
British. Till then it had been our easy custom to talk of
such important matters as reliefs over the telephone from
the front line. It was established that these casual conversations
could be picked up by the enemy's instruments,
especially in chalky ground. They were accordingly banned,
and, after the British manner, from the extreme of imprudence
we rushed to a comical extreme of caution. It
was currently believed that all conversations within three
miles of the line could be heard by the Germans, and brigadiers
sometimes found themselves precluded from using
the telephone. It was still possible to send telegraphic
messages, using the "fullerphone," an invention which
greatly diminished the risk of tapping. And an instrument
of torture, known as the "B.A.B. Code Book," became
part of the equipment of every officer. How many company
commanders have sat in their dug-outs translating a series
of numerals into amazing gibberish, to discover that they
had wasted half an hour by using last month's correction!</p>

<p>On the occasion in question, an officer of the 9th Irish
Fusiliers, Lieutenant Godson, conceived the idea of using
the listening set of the enemy as a bait to take some of his
men. On the afternoon of the 14th of August, he announced
in the clearest possible tones, on a telephone at company
headquarters in the front line, that an officer and three men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
would leave the trench at midnight, and move out on the
right of the Le Rossignol-Messines Road to reconnoitre
the clump of willows in "No Man's Land." At 9-30 p.m.
he moved out to this spot with a party of two officers and
sixteen other ranks. By 10 he had his force in prearranged
formation near the willows, and waited for what might
happen. But he must be allowed to tell in his own words,
as they were written next morning, the story of his sensations
and of his achievement.</p>

<p>"At 11 p.m. I see, I see&mdash;what do I see? A little black
mark in the grass forty yards in front that was not there
when I looked before. O yes, it was. I look about. The
moon is very full out now on our right front. What a nice
night, and so quiet! Not a sound from the German lines.
I look to the front again. I am getting fed with this. I am
wet from head to foot crawling through the wet grass....
This is not a job for one man to be at day after
day. Everyone ought to take his turn at this. The discomfort
is beastly. It is all right till I move, then I have
to warm a new place on the dank grass. Hullo! by Jove,
I've forgotten that black spot, the only thing in sight I
had made a mental note to look at again.... It's
growing bigger. What the devil is it? There's another
behind, and another. They're coming! I have heard of
hearts leaping into the mouth. It meant nothing to me,
but by Jove that's what mine did. It nearly made me
dizzy just for two seconds. I collect myself. Twenty-five
yards off and coming, oh, so slowly and cautiously, moving
down a little ditch in the open that I had not noticed....
I sign to the sick scout to stop his noise and lie
close to the ground. I level my revolver. They're coming.
And one of the other men is sure to make a noise or cough....
I see the first distinctly now, ten yards off,&mdash;nine,
eight, seven, six, five. He sees something, he whips round,
all turn behind him; as far as I can see, three, four, five,
six, seven&mdash;how many? Bang, bang, bang, ring out the
rifles! I let off five with my revolver, and they have disappeared
as if by magic. 'Come on, boys!' I'm up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
out. I see a figure on his back. I leap at his throat.
'Kamerad, Kamerad!' he shouts, and waves his hands.
Clements whips by me and Ervin and Breen."</p>

<p>The net result of the ambuscade was two Germans
killed and four prisoners. That the false message had been
overheard could never be exactly proved, but the probabilities
seemed to be in that direction.</p>

<p>To summarize the raids carried out or attempted during
autumn and winter, there were two on the night of September
the 15th, two on September the 30th, three on October
the 12th, two on the 31st, and one, the most important, on
November the 16th. Of these ten, six were successful in
varying degree. The two first were carried out by the 9th
Rifles, just east of the Wulverghem-Wytschaete Road, and
by the 11th Inniskillings some five hundred yards north
of it. The former, by reason of its neatness and the fact
that the raiders suffered no loss, must be accounted the
best of the series. It was sent to obtain an identification,
and it obtained one, a single prisoner. In addition, the
officer who led it shot two Germans as he entered the trench,
and a third was shot by the flank guard on the left. But
the great achievement of the raid was the work of Rifleman
Kidd, the champion long-distance bomber of the battalion,
a man worth a platoon in such an affair. By his long-range
bombing he kept off, single-handed, the German bombers
moving up to the rescue, killing three. The British casualties
were three men so lightly wounded that they remained
at duty. The other raid was notable for very pretty work
by the Artillery. At this point, opposite Kruisstraat Cabaret,
the British lines jutted out into a work known as the "Bull
Ring," which commanded some relatively high ground,
about seventy yards from the enemy's trench. The raid
was just north of this work, on an enemy trench almost
on the same longitudinal line, yet a machine-gun was able
to fire from the "Bull Ring" two thousand rounds on the
enemy's trenches, while the "box" barrage of the Artillery
was put round the raiding party, and no shell came near it.
Over thirty Germans were estimated to have been killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but, unfortunately, the Inniskillings, besides ten wounded,
had three wounded and missing. One prisoner was taken
as an identification.</p>

<p>The raids on the 30th were part of a series on the whole IX.
Corps front. On the right the 11th Rifles did not start, owing to an
accidental bomb explosion; in the centre the 10th Rifles were held up
by the depth of the wire; on the left the 10th Inniskillings entered
the enemy's trenches&mdash;after the fuse of their ammonal torpedo
had failed to ignite, and the sapper in charge had affixed and lit a
new one under the very noses of the German sentries&mdash;killed a
number of the enemy, blew up dug-outs, took a machine-gun, rifles,
and equipment. In the raids of the 12th of October the 108th Brigade
had again no fortune at the strongly wired Petite Douve Farm, but
the 107th and 109th Brigades each took prisoners. Of the latter
raid, carried out by the 9th Inniskillings, it is related that,
just before it took place, the two officers who planned it were out
in "No Man's Land" having a look round, and lost their way, the
trenches being here only fifty yards apart. Having seen some wire
they could not agree whether it was "ours or theirs," and tossed a
coin in a shell-hole to decide which view should prevail. The winner
approached the wire, put up his head, and was fired at at four yards'
range&mdash;and missed! He bobbed down. Again he took a look, and
again there was a miss by the sentry. Finally he heard footsteps
approach on the trench-boards, and a voice demand: "<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'Jasus, what what'">Jasus, what</ins>
are ye shootin' at?" That was a welcome and homely sound. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sotto
voce</i> explanations followed, and he and his companion came in. The
raids of October the 31st were held up by showers of bombs from the
stout-hearted Swabian peasants of the 26th (Wuertemberg) Division.
But the Wuertembergers were wanted on the Somme. On November the
16th the 11th Inniskillings, raiding the Spanbroek salient on
a front of two hundred yards, came upon their less formidable
successors, a Saxon Division, before they were accustomed to the
new trenches, and dealt with them in terrible fashion. Twenty-three
dead were counted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76"
id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> the trenches, and more than twice as
many must have fallen. The terror-stricken Saxons deserted their
front line on a wide front, and the Inniskillings had their pleasure
with it for half an hour, looting everything which they could carry
over, blowing up all the dug-outs, to the accompaniment of tunes
played in "No Man's Land" on mouth organs. Three prisoners were
taken. Our losses were slight. One of the few successful raids
carried out against the Division in all its career took place on
February the 14th, when the enemy obliterated the trenches on the
Wulverghem-Messines Road and apparently captured two prisoners.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Divisional Artillery,
which had come to France consisting of three 18-pounder
and one 4.5 howitzer Brigades, had been reorganized in
May, the howitzer batteries being divided among the other
three Brigades. A second reorganization took place in
September, to a basis of six-gun instead of four-gun batteries,
though the howitzer batteries did not receive their
extra section of two guns till the New Year. The 154th
Brigade was broken up, and in February 1917 the 172nd
Brigade became the 113th Army Brigade, and left the Division.
The details can best be shown by a tabular statement
which appears in the "Order of Battle." Henceforth
the Artillery consisted of two Brigades only, the 153rd and
the 173rd. A large number of Army Brigades were created
by the reorganization, and were used to increase the artillery
at the disposal of divisions for offensives or in dangerous
sectors. The change had some tactical advantages, but the
lot of the new Army Brigades, "nobody's children" as it
were, and constantly moved from one lively front to another,
could not be described as happy.</p>

<p>The Division always worked hard, but there was probably
no part of the front in which it attempted and accomplished
so much as here. Just at first there was shortage
of material, as there was of ammunition, but the situation
soon improved. By the labours of the Pioneers and Infantry,
working under the supervision of the three Field Companies,
the whole trench system was transformed. Parapets were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
built stout and strong; parados, where none had been
before, appeared to match them. The communication
trenches were strengthened and improved by the famous
"A" frame, the greatest single blessing that authority provided
for troops in Flanders. The deepening of the bed
of the Douve, and the removal of obstructions by the
Engineers, did much to lessen the winter floods. Trench
tramways were laid, good shelters constructed, reinforced
concrete being largely employed. Of these the most interesting
was the battalion headquarters at La Plus Douve
Farm.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> As one approached the place, one saw no sign of
human occupation, nor of its possibility. There was nothing
but a huge roofless farm, built round three sides of a square,
as is common in Flanders. But inside one of the wings
was an unobtrusive concrete structure thirty feet long,
wherein the commanding officer and his staff dwelt in great
comfort, above ground, with ample head-room, real windows,
and protection from "five-nines." The courtyard remained
as it had been when the farm was finally destroyed by
bombardment eighteen months before, and its smashed
reaping-machine, half a bicycle, and old umbrella, seemed
to have grouped themselves after a Bairnsfather drawing.</p>

<p>Mention must here be made of the remarkable underground
barracks, made on the southern slopes of Hill 63
by the Australian Tunnelling Company, to which the troops
of the Division acted as carriers. Driven into the steep flank
of the hill, it was proof against any artillery, lit all through
by electric light, and capable of holding two battalions at
a pinch. There its charm ended, for it must be confessed
that it was damp, close, and malodorous, and that it was
impossible to leave a battalion long in it without ill effects
upon its health.</p>

<p>For the first three months of 1917 the Division was
without its Pioneers, filched by the new "railway king,"
Sir Eric Geddes. The Pioneers worked with their wonted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
vigour on 60 c.m. light railways between Ouderdom, south
of the Salient, and Kemmel, and between Busseboom and
Dickebusch, and also on broad-gauge work. In their
absence it was very difficult to continue the elaborate programmes
of construction. A temporary "Works Battalion,"
one company from each Brigade, with a nucleus of one
hundred trained Pioneers, who had been retained, was
formed to replace them. It was intensely unpopular with
the men, and cannot be said to have been a success. In
February practically all work of other natures ceased, so
that men might be put to that of wiring. The intense
frost had converted the Belgian inundations into solid ice!
They were no obstacle to the enemy, who for some weeks
was suspected of the preparation of an offensive. Certainly
his artillery had become very aggressive, carrying out heavy
bombardments of our trenches and batteries, and shelling
camps in rear. The country was literally sown with wire,
"Plug Street Wood" being such a tangle that it has always
been a mystery to those who saw it how the Germans passed
through it in 1918. The alarm died down presently. It
had never very serious foundation, but the frost in the
ground constituted a risk.</p>

<p>There was one advantage in holding the line in the same
area for a long period. It was possible to provide some
comfort and recreation for the troops. There were a football
competition, boxing competitions, a horse-show, many
sports meetings. A large hut was put up at Dranoutre
for concerts and other entertainments. Over a long period a
'bus ran daily from "Hyde Park Corner," just outside Ploegsteert
village, to Bailleul, which represented with its shops
and eating-houses comparative civilization. Many will recall
with regret its fine square and beautiful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de Ville</i>, all
smashed to powder in 1918. Probably the worst hardships
of the troops were due to the intense cold of that winter.
Life in the trenches was bad enough, but there were many
men who found it easier to sleep there than in their rest
camps. A bare, draughty wooden hut, a temperature of
fifteen degrees below zero, insufficient fuel; it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
require much imagination to conjure up the misery implied
by such conditions.</p>

<p>With early spring came a great burst of activity. In
the last days of the old year the Division had been reorganized
on a two-brigade frontage, so that the troops of one
Brigade might obtain some rest and training. Now, in
mid-March, it closed down to a small front, from the Wulverghem-Wytschaete
Road on the right, to a point opposite
Maedelstede Farm<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> on the left. This was held by one
Brigade, the second being well back about Flêtre, while the
third trained in the pleasant neighbourhood of Lumbres,
west of St. Omer. No longer was the Second Army Cinderella.
Its area was packed with troops. Even the private
soldier, who saw the opening of the splendid new railhead
at Haagedoorne, outside Bailleul, with its maze of sidings,
saw the country covered with transport lines, saw the dumps
grow full, saw the digging of new communication trenches
and the laying of light railways, must have realized that
something was toward. It is certain at least that the enemy
did. On the morning of March the 24th he bombarded
the lines of the 107th Brigade on the right flank and those
of the New Zealanders, its neighbours, for an hour and a
half. Just before dawn his men were seen to issue from
their trenches. Caught by our artillery barrage and the fire
of machine and Lewis guns, the party was swept away like
chaff. He made other unsuccessful attempts to raid the
Division. That, however, represented but one aspect of
his alertness. The more serious was his persistent shelling
of billets and horse-lines, and his bombing of Bailleul. It
was also observed that he had large parties at work on his
rear lines.</p>

<p>The Second Army was preparing the capture of the
Messines-Wytschaete Ridge.</p>

<p>The raiding activity of the Division was renewed in those
last weeks of preparation. On several occasions men slipped
across in broad daylight to the nose of the Spanbroek salient
and threw bombs into the German trenches. On May the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
19th a raid was attempted from the "Bull Ring," but beaten
off by the enemy, who in turn sent over parties in the early
hours of the morning, which were beaten off with loss.
On May the 23rd the 14th Rifles raided the trenches on the
Kemmel-Wytschaete Road, taking a prisoner and confirming
the suspicion that the Germans had reinforced their line.
On the 29th a very big party of Germans, estimated at a
hundred strong, made three attempts to enter the "Bull
Ring," but was kept out by the barrage and the fire of the
Lewis guns. These raids were without doubt attempts to
reach and destroy the mine-shafts in our front line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there had come into the divisional area, and
moved quietly, battery by battery, into the positions already
prepared, the Divisional Artillery of the 32nd Division,
with four Army Artillery Brigades, making a total of 192
field guns and howitzers on the front. All the positions for
the incoming batteries had been constructed by the 36th
Divisional Artillery, and much of their ammunition stacked
in them ready for their use. Upon this General Brock was
most insistent. To him and to the hard work of his subordinates
the newcomers owed provision such as incoming
batteries all too rarely met with. A great mass of heavy
artillery under the orders of the IX. Corps had arrived also,
and was bombarding the slope of the Messines Ridge, doing
great execution upon the concrete shelters with which it
was studded. The Germans could play at this game also,
and they had some tempting targets. All over the back
areas were horses piqueted in the open, troops in tents.
Against these the Germans did much damage with a railway
gun, which, as it could easily be moved, was safe from our
fire. On the night of May the 27th Divisional Headquarters,
which had moved up to their new Ulster Camp, west of
Dranoutre, were bombarded by a 10 c.m. gun. A direct
hit was obtained on one of the huts, and several clerks were
wounded. The shelling continued for two hours, during
which the staff and personnel of the headquarters had to
take to the fields. That which would have been pure
comedy&mdash;for such the spectacle of a whole divisional headquarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
running about in the dark must undoubtedly
appear to the troops&mdash;was turned to tragedy by the death
of Lieut.-Colonel W. A. de C. King, the C.R.E., who was
killed on the spot by one shell. On the following morning
General Nugent moved, with his advanced Headquarters
Staff, to the command post that had been prepared on the
western slope of Kemmel Hill.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May the preliminary bombardment
opened.</p>

<span class="smcap">Messines: June 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The Battle of Messines has more than one claim
to a prominent position in the history of the war. It was, in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'the the first place'">the
first place</ins>, the first completely successful single operation on
the British front. It shares with the action of Malmaison, fought
four months later, the distinction of being the most perfect and
successful example of the limited offensive. Lastly, it was by far
the most elaborately and carefully "mounted" action ever fought by
British arms. Fine as were the fighting qualities of the formations
and units that took part in it, the most remarkable aspects which
stand out when we look back upon it are the perfection of its
organization and of the liaison between all arms. It represented
a triumph of staff work. Every man in the huge force under his
command was made to feel the guiding hand of the Commander of the
Second Army, and of one of the most brilliant staff officers the war
discovered. The troops entered upon it with high heart. The capture
of the Vimy Ridge had seemed of good augury for the year's campaign.
The doubtful success of the French offensive in Champagne, which
might have acted as a check upon this optimism, was not generally
known.</p>

<p>Before no other battle was there such an infinity of
detail to be mastered as in the preparation of this. It
would not be difficult to write fifty pages about the plans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Since space permits of about six only being allotted to
them, it is impossible to do more than outline them in the
briefest manner.</p>

<p>Some idea of the thoroughness of the training for the
assault may be gained when it is recorded that not only
were attacks practised over ground marked out to represent
the German trench system, but officers from the flanking
battalions of divisions attended each others' field days to
ensure that in the minutest details there was harmony along
the line. An elaborate model of the Messines Ridge, with
all its trenches, forts, roads, and woods, was constructed by
the C.E. of the IX. Corps on the slopes of the Scherpenberg
Hill, between Locre and La Clytte. It was surrounded
by a wooden gallery and trench-board walks, so that at least
a company could examine it at one time. The men took
great interest in it, while all day long little knots of officers
were to be observed studying it. Another new feature of
the attack was the message-map served out on a large scale
to officers and N.C.O.'s. This had on one side a map of
the German trenches, on which the position could be marked;
and on the other a skeleton message-form, bringing forcibly
to the mind of the sender those details in a message that
were of importance to the recipient, which, in the heat
of battle, a young and inexperienced officer might forget.</p>

<p>Nothing was studied more carefully than the provision
of food, water, ammunition, and stores for the advancing
troops. In front of the huge divisional dumps at Lindenhoek
cross-roads and "Daylight Corner," on the Lindenhoek-Neuve
Eglise Road, there were an advance dump, a dump
for each of the attacking brigades, six battalion dumps, and
many smaller in the trenches. An elaborate system of pack
transport was devised, two hundred extra pack-saddles with
special crates attached being issued. Two hundred and fifty
"Yukon packs"&mdash;a Canadian device which enabled a man
trained in its use to carry a very heavy load&mdash;were also issued.
Arrangements were made to serve in the trenches a hot meal
at midnight prior to the assault. A special ration of oranges,
Oxo cubes, chewing gum, and lime juice was issued to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
man, and a tin of solidified alcohol for cooking to every
fourth man.</p>

<p>Means of communication, by visual signalling, pigeons,
wireless, the fullerphone, runners, and the rocket for S.O.S.
calls, were worked out in detail. For the fullerphone there
were two lines of buried cables, with cable-heads in our front
line trenches. Forward stations were selected in the enemy's
line at Spanbroekmolen and Peckham, to which armoured
lines were to be laid across "No Man's Land," from the
cable-heads, by the brigade forward parties. As soon as
the final objective was reached, these forward stations were
to move to the crest of the ridge. Working independently
of this machinery, which was in the hands of the Signal
Service, were the brigade and battalion intelligence sections,
the former of which were to establish observation posts at
Spanbroekmolen and Peckham, while the latter moved up
behind their battalions, selected observation posts to follow
their movements and cover their final position, and sent out
scouts to obtain touch with flanking battalions and bring
information as to their progress. For visual signalling a
divisional signal station was established on Kemmel Hill,
which had a clear line to the brigade forward stations, so
that messages could be sent either forward or back by the
Lucas lamp.</p>

<p>The Second Army was to attack the Messines-Wytschaete
Ridge, and the ground east of it as far as the
Oosttaverne line.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The IX. Corps was allotted from the
Wulverghem-Wytschaete Road to the Diependaal Beek, a
distance of six thousand four hundred yards along the front
line of the enemy's salient. It was to attack with three
divisions in line: from right to left the 36th (Ulster) Division,
the 16th (Irish) Division, and the 19th (Western)
Division. These troops were to advance to the Black Line,
east of the Messines-Wytschaete Road, after which the 11th
Division, in Corps Reserve, was to pass through to the final
objective. A glance at the map will show how the frontage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of attack narrowed with every thousand yards of the advance.
On the right of the 36th Division was the 25th, in the II.
Anzac Corps.</p>

<p>The attack of the 36th Division, of which the final
objective was from Lumm Farm to a cutting on the Wytschaete-Oosttaverne
Road east of Staenyzer Cabaret, was to
be made by two Brigades, the 107th on the right and the
109th on the left, each having one battalion from the 108th
Brigade attached. Each Brigade was to attack with two battalions
in front, which advanced as far as the Blue Line,
the ground in rear of that objective being "mopped up"
by the attached battalion of the 108th Brigade. The remaining
two battalions of each Brigade were to pass through
on the Blue Line for the advance to the Black, providing
their own "mopping-up" parties. The 107th Brigade was
to use the 8th Rifles on the right and the 9th on the left
for the attack on the Blue Line, with the 15th and 10th
Rifles to pass through to the Black Line. The 12th Rifles,
from the 108th Brigade, carried out the work of "mopping
up" and consolidation in rear. The 109th Brigade was to
use the 14th Rifles on the right and the 11th Inniskillings
on the left to take the Blue Line, and the 10th and 9th Inniskillings
to take the Black Line. The 11th Rifles were
attached for consolidation and "mopping up." The boundary
line between the 36th and 16th Divisions ran, it will be
noticed, along the main street of Wytschaete, half the village
being in the objective of each Division.</p>

<p>The date of the attack was designated "Z" day, the
five days of preliminary bombardment being designated
"U," "V," "W," "X," and "Y." There had been
considerable bombardment of the ridge before "U" day,
but from this day onwards it became more intense. Its
object was not the total destruction of the hostile trench
system, but the disorganization of the defence by the smashing
of concrete emplacements and shelters. It took nothing
short of an 8-inch howitzer to destroy the German concrete,
while 12-inch and 15-inch howitzers fired on Wytschaete.
The cutting of wire was performed by the 18-pounders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
assisted in the case of the front line by trench mortars.
Further to disorganize the enemy, a programme of barraging
night and day his communications, and shelling his
billets, was carried out, while bursts of fire with lethal and
lachrymatory gas shell of various sorts took place throughout
the period. Special half-hour hurricane bombardments of
Messines and Wytschaete, during which every gun available,
from largest to smallest, was in action, were carried out.
The barrage for the advance consisted of, firstly, a creeping
barrage of 18-pounder shrapnel, moving in advance of the
infantry, with average lifts of a hundred yards, at the rate
of a hundred yards in three minutes; and, secondly, a standing
barrage of 18-pounders, 4.5 inch howitzers, and medium
and heavy howitzers, established in succession on trenches
and strong points. For the creeping barrage there was one
gun to twenty yards, firing at maximum rate. One gun
a section fired smoke shell, to screen the infantry. The
barrage was highly complicated, as, owing to the configuration
of the German salient and the varying rate of the
advance, it lifted off none of the objectives at the same
moment all along the line.</p>

<p>Meticulous care was taken by Army Headquarters to
ensure that the preparation was as complete as human forethought
could make it. Each morning air photographs,
showing the effect of the previous day's bombardment, were
circulated to Divisions in the line. Each Division was required
to state, day by day, what further special bombardment
it desired. From its observation post on Kemmel
Hill the Staff of the 36th Division could see practically all
the slope of the Messines Ridge, from just above the dip
of the Steenebeek valley to the crest. Day by day it studied
the ground during the bombardment. A trench or concrete
work which did not appear to have been sufficiently shelled
was noted, and request made that it should receive further
attention next day. Such requests were invariably met.
Trenches and dug-outs were shelled again and again, till
Divisional Headquarters declared itself satisfied. Many of
the concrete structures were revealed only when the bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the trenches had blown away the earth about
them. They were then subjected to the fire of heavy
howitzers till destroyed. Finally, each Division was asked
to state if it were satisfied with the preparation. In the
case of the 36th Division at least, the answer was an
enthusiastic affirmative.</p>

<p>The sympathy and understanding which existed between
the Staff of the Second Army and the man in the fighting
line created a moral tone of incalculable value to the Army's
efficiency as a striking force.</p>

<p>The work of the preliminary bombardment threw a great
strain upon the personnel of the artillery, though such rest
as possible was given by carefully organized reliefs. The
infantry was greatly impressed with the results it could
witness. In particular the liaison between infantry and
heavy gunners, hardly thought of before this action, was
of the closest, the artillery officers bringing battalion commanders
aeroplane photographs to show the results of the
bombardment on their front.</p>

<p>Stokes mortars and machine-guns were assigned important
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôles</i> in the early part of the attack. The 3-inch
mortars belonging to the Division, less four a brigade, to
be taken forward in the attack, were to open a hurricane
bombardment for three and a half minutes at "Zero."
A battery of 4-inch Stokes mortars, specially attached, was
to preface the assault with a bombardment of the Spanbroek
salient, with two lifts, using the highly demoralizing incendiary
shell known as "thermit." Six guns of the Machine-Gun
Companies of the attacking Brigades were to go forward
with them; the rest of the guns of these companies, with
those of the 108th, the 32nd, two sections of the 33rd, and
six guns of the 19th Motor Machine-Gun Battery,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> a total
of sixty-six guns, were to be employed to provide a creeping
barrage beyond that of the artillery, a standing barrage
on the main defences of the ridge, and fire on strong points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
woods, and ravines. One section of Tanks<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> was allotted.
They were not to catch up the infantry till the Blue Line
was reached, and in the advance to the Black Line were to
concentrate mainly upon Wytschaete.</p>

<p>All the successive lines, with the exception of the Green,
were to be consolidated, special strong points being established
at such positions as L'Enfer Farm, Skip Point, and
Jump Point, in the Blue Line; and Lumm Farm, Pick
House, and Torreken Farm in the Black. The infantry
was to start the work of consolidation; then, when the
Black Line had been taken, the 121st and 150th Field Companies
were to move up to work upon the principal strong
points. After dusk on the evening of "Z" day, the 122nd
Field Company was to move up and construct a wire entanglement
along the whole front of the Black Line. Small
opportunity, it will be seen, was left for successful counter-attack
if the assault reached its objectives.</p>

<p>Two contact aeroplanes were to be in the air at once
throughout the battle, calling at fixed hours, by the sounding
of a Klaxon horn and the firing of a Vérey light, for the
signals by which the infantry was to mark its progress.
The latter consisted of green flares, lit in bunches of three,
and the turning of Watson fans, marked white on one side
and black on the other.</p>

<p>A whole series of mines, the greatest ever used in war,
was to be fired at "Zero." Of these there were three on
the 36th Division's front: one at Kruisstraat Cabaret, one
at Spanbroekmolen, and one at Peckham. The second
had been doubtful up to the last minute. The passage to
the charge had been cut some time before by a German
defensive "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">camouflet</span>," and it had seemed as though the toil
of a year and of thousands of men had been wasted. The
tunnellers of the 171st Company had laboured unceasingly
to cut a new gallery. On the eve of the action a scribbled
note from the commanding officer to Colonel Place, G.S.O.1.
of the Division, announced that the work was accomplished
and that it was "almost certain" the mine would go up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
In case there might be failure with this or any other charge,
the assaulting infantry was instructed not to wait more than
fifteen seconds after the opening of the barrage before
leaving its trenches.</p>

<p>For the evacuation of the wounded there was an Advanced
Dressing Station at Lindenhoek, close to the main
road, skilfully prepared by the 109th Field Ambulance.
Wounded could be carried into the main shelter by the
entrance on the north side, from the trench tramway, given
what attention was necessary, and conveyed out by the exit
on the west side, where the motor ambulances of the Division
arrived by a specially constructed semi-circular road.
This relieved the main road at that point, and enabled the
cars to sweep round without turning. The cars bore the
wounded to the Main Dressing Station just east of Dranoutre,
manned by the 108th Field Ambulance, while "walking
wounded" were sent by a specially-marked track to the
Main Dressing Station prepared for them and manned by
the 110th Field Ambulance a mile east of the village. From
these Dressing Stations the Motor Ambulance Park had the
task of carrying the wounded to the two Casualty Clearing
Stations in Bailleul. Distances were shorter and roads better
than on the Somme; and, had the casualties been as many
as on that occasion, they would have been removed in less
than half the time and with far less discomfort to the
wounded. As it most happily chanced, the casualties were
less than a fourth of those at Thiepval.</p>

<p>So much for the preparations. Any of importance which
have not been mentioned will appear in the account of the
actual battle.</p>

<p>The 108th Brigade held the line during the period of
preliminary bombardment, employing for the purpose the
two battalions which it was to retain during the battle as
divisional reserve. It having been decided to carry out some
practice barrages in broad daylight, to note the effect of
the smoke shell, and see whether any guns were shooting
short, these seemed to offer good opportunity for big raids.
The first of these raids took place at 3 p.m. on June the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
3rd. A party of three officers and seventy other ranks of
the 13th Rifles entered the enemy's trenches at Peckham
behind the barrage, and after a short bombing fight captured
nineteen prisoners of the 2nd German Division. On
the following afternoon at 2 p.m., a larger party of the 9th
Irish Fusiliers followed the barrage into the Spanbroek
salient, returning with one officer and thirty men as prisoners&mdash;a
remarkable haul for a raid. Their casualties were
two killed and six wounded. It was a fine, sunny day, and,
despite the haze of dust caused by the shelling, the whole
operation could be seen in detail from the observation posts
on Kemmel Hill. The barrage, though the rate of fire was
but a third of what it was to be on the great day, was very
impressive. It appeared a wall of curling smoke creeping
slowly up the ridge. The figures of the infantrymen following
it could be seen distinctly; there was the flash of
bombs, and there were Germans coming from their dug-outs
holding up their arms. As the party returned one man was
seen to break away from it, walk back fifty yards in most
leisurely fashion, summon forth two Germans whom he had
evidently observed hiding in a hole, and bring them in at
the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>The day of battle was at hand. Nothing could have
been more favourable than the elements to the British cause.
The weather was clear for observation, dry, and not unduly
cold at night.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The infantry which was to make the attack
was bivouacked in tents and shelters, the 107th Brigade
south of Locre, the 109th S.W. of Dranoutre, thus avoiding
the shelling, particularly with gas, wherewith the Germans
visited all our hutted camps. After dusk on June the 6th, "Y"
day, these Brigades moved up to their positions of assembly,
which consisted partly of our front and support line trenches,
and partly of slit trenches specially dug. As on the occasion
of the assembly for the Somme Battle, cross-country tracks
had been prepared to avoid the congested roads. East of the
Neuve Eglise-Lindenhoek Road there were no less than four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
tracks available for each brigade. It was reported that the
assembly was complete, without a hitch, by 2-30 a.m. on
June the 7th.</p>

<p>The reader must strive to imagine the emotions of the
men who waited in the dark for the fateful moment. Some,
the luckier ones, those of the battalions and attached troops
that were to take the Blue Line, had but another forty minutes,
though those forty minutes must have seemed long
enough. The battalions which were to pass through them
on that objective had two hours after that. It was eleven
months since the Division had made its first great attack.
Despite its heavy losses on that day and since, there was here
a large proportion of officers and men who had taken part in
it, including many who had then been wounded. They must
have recalled, as they waited for the crash of opening artillery,
with what high hopes they had gone forward on the
banks of the Ancre. The task must have appeared to them
almost equally formidable to-day. And yet there was a
general feeling of confidence, and confidence not unreasoned.
The British Army had learnt much since then, and the men
in the line realized the growth of that knowledge and had
their part in it. They had watched the stage prepared for
the triumphant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i>, prepared with matchless industry
and forethought, and they were ready to play their
part fitly when the curtain rose. There was among the
men, it may be, less of that spirit of gay, generous, headlong
valour, ready to spill itself without a thought of the cost,
but there was a greater store of the soldier's craft; the craft
which seeks to save itself that it may inflict the more loss
upon the opponent. In fighting efficiency the Division, war-tried,
but not war-weary, was probably, in the small hours
of that June morning, at the highest pitch it ever attained.</p>

<p>Zero was at 3-10 a.m. It had been fixed, after long consultation
with Divisions, by the Army as the hour at which
men should be able to see just one hundred yards ahead.
In the conferences after the battle the general opinion
seemed to be that it had been put five or ten minutes too
early. It had been arranged that a normal programme of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
harassing fire should be carried out, as a cessation of this
would have appeared suspicious to the enemy. It seemed,
nevertheless, to those who watched and waited, that the
night was unusually quiet. A few of our howitzers spoke
now and again, and from the German lines came regularly
the hiccoughing double thud of their great gun, followed
by the whine of its missile overhead, on its course to some
objective as far back as Hazebrouck.</p>

<p>Then, with one monstrous roar, every British gun upon
ten miles of front opened fire. At the same time the great
semi-circle of mines exploded, spewing up, as it seemed,
the solid earth, of which fragments fell half a mile away,
and sending to the skies great towers of crimson flame, that
hung a moment ere they were choked by the clouds of
dense black smoke which followed them from their caverns.
There came first one ghastly flash of light, then a shuddering
of earth thus outraged, then the thunder-clap. That
opening uproar was heard quite distinctly in England.
General Nugent, returning to his command post on Kemmel
from the observation post a hundred yards away,
declared that the sight he had seen was "a vision of hell."</p>

<p>Amid a gloom still thick and intensified by a smother
of dust, the first wave of the infantry sprang from its
trenches and went forward. The second followed at twenty-five
yards' interval to avoid the German barrage. One of
the mines was fifteen seconds late. Curiously enough, it
was the doubtful one at Spanbroekmolen. The infantry
had obeyed instructions and had not waited for it. A few
of the leading men of the 14th Rifles, out in "No Man's
Land," were thrown off their feet by the force of the explosion.
But there were no casualties, and the men quickly
closed in to the barrage. The size of the craters to be
skirted and the darkness made the keeping of direction a
matter of difficulty. It would have been impossible but
for the use of compasses by the platoon commanders. There
was considerable overlapping by the troops of the Division
on our right, at least two companies of which swung across
our front. The body of one of their officers was subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
found in the bed of the Steenebeek, at L'Enfer
Wood, over two hundred yards within the 36th Division's
boundary.</p>

<p>There was no resistance by the enemy in his front or
support trenches. Dazed and disorganized by the mines
and the tremendous weight of artillery, the few survivors
surrendered. Two machine-guns only, firing through our
barrage, are recorded to have come into action at this stage,
on the front of the 109th Brigade. They came into the
open when it had passed, on the extreme left flank, and were
put out of action, one by a section of rifle grenadiers, the
other by a Lewis gun of the 11th Inniskillings. The
enemy's barrage was unaccountably light and ragged, even
when the violence of our counter-battery fire is considered,
and fell upon the British front line. The assaulting troops
went straight forward to the Red Line, close upon the barrage,
leaving to the "moppers up" the task of taking prisoners.
It was reached at Zero plus 35; that is, at 3-45 a.m.
Here there was a halt in the barrage of a quarter of an hour,
and here the third and fourth company of each battalion
"leap-frogged" the first and second for the assault of the
Blue Line. The serious business of the attack was but
beginning.</p>

<p>As in almost every action of the war, the stoutest-hearted
German was the German behind the machine-gun.
The artillerymen, with shell hailing upon their positions,
were more anxious to withdraw their batteries than to
support their infantry, but the machine-gunners lived up
to their reputation. As the new waves swept on, dipping
now on the right brigade front into the marshy bed of the
Steenebeek, guns came into action directly the barrage was
past at L'Enfer Wood, Earl Farm, Skip Point, and Scott
Farm. At Skip Point, in particular, two guns were handled
with boldness, firing till the work was rushed with the
bayonet by the 9th Rifles, assisted by a platoon of the 14th,
which swung in from the left. There was still resistance
in this veritable fortress, and some bombing of its dug-outs.
Upwards of a hundred and fifty prisoners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
taken in it. At Scott Farm an officer was seen standing on
top of the work, encouraging his men. He was shot at
long range by a sniper, whereat the defence at this point
collapsed. There yet remained, however, Jump Point, the
strongest position short of the road. By this time the Intelligence
Officer of the 109th Brigade was on the high
ground beyond Peckham, in touch with his Brigadier on
the telephone. He reported that he saw a yellow flag at
Jump Point. Now, the battalion flag of the 14th Rifles was
<em>orange</em>, a far more significant shade. "I said," writes
General Ricardo, "'Yellow be damned!' slammed down
the 'phone, called the Division on the other, and said I
wished to report that Jump Point was occupied. Corps
was informed accordingly, within a few minutes of schedule
time. I was asked by B.G.G.S. Corps next day how we
managed our information and communications. I told
him, 'by orange flags.'" And so the first flag moved forward
from the border of the map at IX. Corps Headquarters,
which was to mark the progress of the battle, and was stuck
into Jump Point.</p>

<p>All along the front the leading waves, well closed up
to the barrage, reached the Blue Line at the appointed
hour, 4-50 a.m. The troops of the 36th Division were in
touch with those of the 25th and 16th Divisions on right
and left, both of which also reached their objectives successfully.
Here there was a halt of two hours, during which
consolidation was begun, during which also the battalions
attacking the Black Line, the 15th and 10th Rifles and the
10th and 9th Inniskillings, moved up in artillery formation.
The two former battalions had to pass through a light barrage
which the enemy had now put down upon the valley
of the Steenebeek, but had not many casualties. At 6-50
a.m. the barrage moved forward once more, the fresh troops
following it with great dash.</p>

<p>The severest resistance was not met here till the Green
Line was past and the troops were almost on the famous
road, upon which they had looked so long. Pick House
was strongly held. With the rifle grenade it was attacked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
while a captured machine-gun was brought into action
against it from the flank.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The garrison, which included a
battalion commander, then surrendered. A little further
north the 10th Inniskillings were held up by a machine-gun.
A tank was just in front, but the occupants apparently
could not see the gun, nor could the infantrymen attract
their attention to it. A sergeant of the Inniskillings ran up
to the tank, beat upon its side with a Mills bomb, and so
gained the attention of the crew. The tank then bore
down upon the machine-gun and put it out of action. Still
further north, on their extreme left flank, the 10th had
trouble from a line of riflemen behind a ditch. A platoon
of their neighbours, the 9th Inniskillings, outflanked this
party, killing three and making prisoners of the rest. In
their half of Wytschaete the 9th Inniskillings had some
"mopping up" to accomplish, and took about fifty prisoners.
Their neighbours, the Munsters of the 16th Division,
had a like task in the northern half of the village&mdash;a
village that was now a crumbled rubbish-heap of bricks,
nowhere more than a few feet high.</p>

<p>But the point at which resistance was most dogged was
on the extreme right, and it was the 15th Rifles which had
the heaviest casualties among the infantry. The following
graphic account is taken from a letter written by Captain
P. K. Miller, who commanded the right flank company of
this battalion:</p>

<p>"About a hundred, or perhaps two hundred, yards short
of the Messines-Wytschaete Road we came into a lot of
machine-gun fire, and the men went to ground to find out
where it came from, so I crossed the road and lay down
on the other side for about five minutes and got my field-glasses
going. Very warm spot, as our barrage was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'drop-ing'">dropping</ins>
about there! Beat it back to the company, and ordered
Lieut. Falkiner to take his platoon, less Lewis-gun team,
and put out of action the strong point which I had spotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
on my right. Got the L.G. in action to spray the place
meantime (had three out of five riflemen killed doing this;
however, they kept the gun going). Then I went along to
left of line and started Lieut. &mdash;&mdash; of 'B' Company (forget
his name, but he got the M.C. for it) to attack another
S.P. which was plugging at our left. (O.C. 'B' Company
had got a 'blighty' coming up hill.) Then I went
back to the right of the line and found that Lieut. Falkiner
had got Lumm Farm. The Huns put up a fight here.
However, one of the concrete places was bombed by Riflemen
Aicken and Cochrane. In the other the Hun officer
and Lieut. Falkiner had a rough-and-tumble fight. The
Hun collared him somehow round the waist, but he managed
to get an arm free and shot him, and his men came
tumbling down after him and finished the rest of them.
About fifteen were left alive and surrendered....
I then pushed all the men on a hundred yards and started
them digging.... Some time later the commander of
the (25th Division) company on my right came along and
asked me if I would let him use Lumm Farm as a company
headquarters, as he had no dug-outs in his sector. So I
gave him one of the rooms&mdash;there were three or four in
the dug-out."</p>

<p>The final part of this first-hand narrative is inserted
because, in a book recently published, the capture of Lumm
Farm is attributed to the 25th Division.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Consolidation of the Black Line was started. At 8-40
a.m. patrols pushed forward in touch with those of the
25th and 16th Divisions, and established themselves without
much difficulty a thousand yards ahead, on what had been
known on the preliminary plans as the Dotted Black Line,
afterwards called the Mauve Line, which was held as an
outpost line. Meanwhile, in the lull that followed, the field
artillery was moving forward. Most of the batteries moved
to the neighbourhood of the old British front line, but
batteries of the 153rd and 173rd Brigades crossed "No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Man's Land," and established themselves as far forward as
the Red Line. The gunners, in the enthusiasm of victory,
forgot their fatigue and the strain of those sleepless nights
of bombardment, and rushed their guns forward over the
difficult ground with the delight of schoolboys. At 10-5
a.m. it was reported to General Nugent that batteries of the
173rd Brigade were in position. A few minutes later came
a similar report with regard to the 153rd Brigade. Not for
upwards of two hours was there sign of a counter-attack in
force. Then the IX. Corps announced that long columns
of troops and transport had been observed by balloon and
aeroplane moving west from the canal at Houthem. The
German command had, however, been too slow. By this time
good progress had been made with the work of consolidation
of the Black Line, and of the strong points in rear of it, the
latter of which the engineers of the 121st and 150th Field
Companies had already taken in hand. In addition to the
wire brought forward on pack mules, far greater quantities
of German wire had been found, particularly at one big
dump near Guy Farm. All the twelve Vickers guns which
had gone forward with the infantry had arrived successfully.
There were now three in position north of Lumm Farm,
three between Guy Farm and Staenyzer Cabaret, three some
hundred yards west of the main road, and two in reserve.
All the sixteen guns of the 108th Machine-Gun Company
were in position in their rear, a battery of eight east of
L'Enfer Wood, four at Jump Point, and four on Hill 94,
at the south-west corner of Wytschaete. A big counter-attack
would have driven in the outposts on the Mauve
Line; it appeared improbable that it would dislodge our
troops from the Black. When it came, a little after one
o'clock, it was not on the front of the 36th Division, but
on that of its right-hand neighbours, the 25th and New
Zealand Divisions. The Germans came forward stoutly
enough across the open ground, but the attack got nowhere
near the British lines. Before the terrific blast of our barrage
it withered away and dispersed.</p>

<p>The heat was now very great and the stench round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Wytschaete from the many horses that had been killed by
our bombardments of the past week was almost overwhelming.
The troops were suffering from fatigue. It was
the hour at which reaction from the strain he has endured,
and the high pitch to which he has keyed himself, begins
to creep upon all but the very strongest of men. They
solaced themselves during the intervals of digging and
wiring with the doubtful joys of German ration cigars,
found in great quantities in some of the dug-outs. The
Germans had begun to shell Messines and Wytschaete
heavily.</p>

<p>The hour of the "New Zero"&mdash;that is, for the passing
through of the troops of the 11th Division&mdash;had been fixed
meanwhile at 3-10 p.m. At 12-20 p.m. came an order from
the IX. Corps that the Mauve Line was to be held in force
and consolidated, so that a good second line of defence should
be prepared by the time the 11th Division had captured
the Oosttaverne Line. Each Brigade was accordingly instructed
to garrison the Mauve Line with a battalion. Each
Brigadier decided to use the attached battalion of the 108th
Brigade which had been employed for "mopping up," and
so was fresher than his other battalions. Before three
o'clock the 12th and 11th Rifles were upon the Mauve
Line, and at work putting it into a state of defence.</p>

<p>Punctually at 3-10 p.m. the 34th Brigade of the 11th
Division moved through the Mauve Line, behind a splendid
barrage and with four tanks. Though less artillery was
firing, the barrage was even thicker than had been that of
the 36th Division, owing to the frontage having been reduced
to less than one half. It reached its objective, the
Oosttaverne Line, but was subjected to intense bombardment
from the German artillery, now all east of the Canal.
The IX. Corps Cavalry went through at 6 p.m.&mdash;too late,
even if it had ever had a chance. It suffered casualties
from machine-gun fire, and could make little or no progress.</p>

<p>The 16th Rifles (Pioneers) had attacked their heavy task
of road-making. Bridges for the trenches had been prepared
and were set in position. Shell-holes were hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
filled. With such a will did the two companies on the road
work, that before dusk wheeled transport could move on the
Lindenhoek-Messines Road beyond the great crater in the
Spanbroek salient. Another company cleared tracks for
pack transport up to the Black Line, marking them out with
white stakes and notice-boards. After the taking of the
Oosttaverne Line the battalion turned its attention to the top
of the ridge, clearing old communication trenches and cutting
new ones. The 122nd Field Company put up a fine
obstacle along the whole length of the Black Line, using,
for the most part, German wire. This task was completed
by 3 a.m. on June the 8th.</p>

<p>It was an ideal opportunity for the employment of pack
transport. Once the enemy had been pushed off the ridge
it was secure from ground observation, while, as for
German aeroplanes, they had no chance to cross our lines,
so complete was the British mastery of the air. The pack
was one of the successes of the battle. Officers commanding
battalions had in most cases picked their headquarters in
the enemy's lines days before, and told their transport
officers they would expect them at such an hour with the
rations, just as if they had been holding the most placid
trenches on the front. They were not disappointed. Indeed,
mules were moving up with grenades, water, and wire,
before ever the Black Line was reached. The transport
officers of the battalions showed in this action that long
months of stagnation in the war had not robbed them of
their initiative.</p>

<p>The forward slopes of the Messines Ridge, ere dusk put
for a while a decent veil upon it, presented a ghastly spectacle
to bear witness to the destructive power of modern
artillery. The ground had been literally ploughed up.
L'Enfer Wood, which had remained a considerable copse
of stunted trees through years of shell-fire, was now but an
indeterminate collection of stumps. Some of the concrete
structures had disappeared. The Steenebeek stream was a
stream no more. Its path was marked by mud thicker than
elsewhere, and where its bed had been the shell-holes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
full of water. There were a number of dead Germans in
the valley, with their faces turned toward the hill. They
had run back before the dreadful moving wall of the British
barrage, and had been caught by it in the marshy ground.
Some lay on their faces, arms outstretched. It was a
sight that, at normal times, would have filled the breast of
everyone who witnessed it with pity and horror. But in
such moments the wells of these emotions are almost
dried up.</p>

<p>At night the 108th Brigade relieved the 107th and 109th
in the line; that is to say, its remaining battalions, which
had been in divisional reserve, relieved the troops holding
the Black and Blue Lines, while General Griffith took
command of the front. The relieved troops moved back to the
comparative comfort of the old British trenches. The night
was very disturbed. On more than one occasion the S.O.S.
rocket went up on the right of the Division, and at 10 p.m.
a counter-attack on Messines was reported. If counter-attack
there was, it was of small account. No big attack
could, in fact, have been carried out in the darkness. Morning
dawned, leaving the British in secure occupation of the
battlefield and all their objectives. The ridge was, however,
subjected to very heavy shelling all that day and at
night, when the 150th Field Company had a very wild task
in wiring the whole of the Mauve Line. On the afternoon
of the following day, at 4 p.m., command of the sector,
the actual front line of which had been held for upwards
of forty-eight hours by his troops, passed to the G.O.C.
11th Division. That night the 32nd Brigade of the 11th
Division relieved the 108th Brigade in the Mauve, Black,
and Blue Lines, the weary battalions moving back to
bivouac on the slopes of Kemmel Hill. On the 16th the
Headquarters of the 36th Division returned to their old
village, St. Jans Cappel.</p>

<p>The total number of prisoners captured by the 36th
Division in the offensive was 31 officers and 1,208 other
ranks. Against this its casualties, to the night of June the
9th, when it was relieved, were 61 officers and 1,058 other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ranks. In the actual assault, the losses were probably not
above seven hundred. Other divisions, notably some of the
Australians of the II. Anzac Corps, suffered more severely
than the 36th; but, on the whole, it seems safe to presume
that the German losses were more than thrice our own.
One prisoner stated that practically all his company was
destroyed by one of the mines, while the tenor of the letters
found upon others was that it had been "far worse than
the Somme." No German field guns could be withdrawn
by our troops before the Division was relieved, but a number
were captured between the Black Line and the Mauve.
Among the comparatively few officers killed was Captain
H. Gallagher, D.S.O., of the 11th Inniskillings, whose
gallantry and fine leadership upon the Somme have been
recorded. At the beginning of the action his right arm was
shattered by a fragment of shell. Urged to go back, he
laughingly refused, threw down the rifle he was carrying,
and took his revolver in his left hand, saying: "This will
do me rightly." He led his company to its objective, and
was returning later to have his arm dressed when he was
killed instantly by a shell. He was buried in the old
"No Man's Land," just outside the "Bull Ring," which he
had so often held, from which he and his company had
repulsed a big German raiding party a short while before.</p>

<p>The 16th Division lost one distinguished man in Major
William Redmond, M.P., who was brought in by stretcher-bearers
of the 36th Division, and conveyed to its Main
Dressing Station. He had been attached to Divisional Headquarters,
but had insisted on rejoining his regiment for the
battle. His wound was light, but he was no longer a young
man, nor in a state of physical fitness to withstand such
a strain. He died some hours later.</p>

<p>The 36th Division had by no means finished with the
Messines-Wytschaete Ridge, even for this year; but before
dealing with its last days in the area, it may be not unprofitable
to speculate upon the causes of this triumphant success.
If this account has achieved its object, the majority of them
will stand out clearly enough. In the conferences after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
battle, and in reply to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">questionnaires</i> issued by the commanders,
there were very few criticisms made. Zero, as
has been stated, was considered to have been too early,
though by not more than a few minutes at most. All the
infantry was enthusiastic about the manner in which the
artillery had been handled, and about the effect of the
barrage. Some battalions considered that it had been set
to move rather too fast, but the general opinion was that
the infantry had been able to keep up with it comfortably
enough, and that the pace was a factor in the success. The
mines, it was agreed, had been decisive in the capture of
the front-line system, and had exercised a great moral effect
much farther back. The tanks had been a success. They
were useful in incidents such as that which has been described,
and they probably saved the infantry some casualties
on the top of the ridge. Broadly speaking, however,
they did not appear to have exercised any great effect upon
the course of the battle. Brigadiers and battalion commanders
were unanimous in praise of the smoothness with
which the machinery worked from behind. The services
of supply&mdash;the Divisional Train, Supply Column, and Divisional
Ammunition Column&mdash;were at their best, and their
standard of excellence was high. The Ordnance had responded
to every demand made upon it for the multifarious
material used in the offensive.</p>

<p>With regard to the infantry itself, the most interesting
feature of the Battle of Messines was the triumph of the
platoon. Each platoon had now a Lewis-gun section and
a section of rifle grenadiers. It was converted thereby into
a little self-sufficing force, an army in miniature, with every
weapon necessary for the carrying out of the minor operations
likely to confront it in such an assault. Some of
the platoon leaders displayed in this battle a high order of
tactical skill.</p>

<p>But let us glance also at the affair from the other side,
where a German Army Commander, the famous Sixt von
Armin, was seated at his map-table. What were the problems
that confronted him, and how did he face them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans meant to hold the ridge if they could.
It was a valuable position that had cost them dear in the
winning. They knew an attack was coming, but they put
it one or two days later than it was delivered. The Higher
Command was well aware that the troops in the trenches
were in no fit state to meet it, after days of terrific pounding,
heavy losses, and shortage of food. It was in the act of
relieving them when the attack was launched. The relief
of one Division was incomplete when the mines went up
and the British bayonets came in the dark upon the
columns in the communication trenches. The confusion
must have been indescribable. Again, the German position,
admirable for trench warfare, had weaknesses in such a
battle as this. It was a sharp salient, with a semi-circle of
artillery about it. The artillery had excellent observation.
Had the weather been misty, Kemmel would have been of
little avail, and the work of destruction comparatively ineffective.
But the atmosphere was wonderfully clear. The
British fire upon the forts was overwhelming. The counter-battery
work was the best accomplished in the war. An
average of one gun to every German battery in action was
destroyed by our fire, according to the evidence of captured
artillerymen. The loss in horses alone constituted a severe
blow. As to the counter-attack, which was made in the
afternoon with the 7th and probably regiments of the 24th
Divisions, it was launched late, and met the full weight of
our barrage. With its failure the High Command appears
to have decided, wisely no doubt, to abandon the struggle,
and made all haste to get every gun left to it east of the
Canal d'Ypres. It must have appeared to it that the position
held by the British offered doubtful results to a counter-attack
in force. The latter had now all the best of the
ground, and a great counter-attack upon the re-entrant held
by them would have required more troops than the enemy
probably had available.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July the 36th Division, less its Artillery,
which remained in position, moved to the area between
Mont Noir and Bailleul. A certain amount of rest was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
obtained, but large parties of infantry had to work under
the Chief Engineer of the IX. Corps. However, better
things were in prospect, the Division being under orders to
move back to Merris. These orders were suddenly cancelled.
On the night of the 19th, the 107th Brigade on the
right, and the 109th on the left, took over from the 11th
Division the whole front now held by the IX. Corps, from
the Blauwepoortbeek at Deconinck Farm, just north of the
village of Gapaard, on the right, to Rose Wood, north of
the Roozebeek, on the left. The length of the front was
about three thousand yards. The Headquarters of the
107th Brigade were established in a company headquarters
of our old trenches, those of the 109th Brigade in enemy
dug-outs in the northern part of Grand Bois. On the 20th,
36th Divisional Headquarters opened at Ulster Camp.</p>

<p>The holding of a new-won position after a great attack
was always an unpleasant task. In this case the conditions
were, from some points of view, more difficult than those of
the capture of the ridge. "Jerry was angry," said the men,
with justice. The Germans now had a mass of heavy artillery
behind the Canal d'Ypres, and day and night they
shelled the British forward positions and the western slope
of the ridge. On their second day in the line the Headquarters
of the 109th Brigade in the Grand Bois were so
heavily bombarded that General Nugent decided they should
be withdrawn to a company headquarters in our old lines.
The troops in the front trenches were on a forward slope,
very exposed to observation, and suffered heavily. At night
ration parties on the roads had many evil experiences. Casualties
rarely amounted to less than a hundred for the period
of twenty-four hours, and several battalions had considerably
greater losses in ten days of this experience than in the
period from the 7th to the 9th of June.</p>

<p>Nor was it alone upon areas over which he had
observation from the ground that the enemy was able to
bring to bear accurate fire. Parties on railway work,
lorries on the Wytschaete Road, suffered very heavily also.
The reason was that the situation in the air had altered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
British supremacy there had been absolute. Not a German
aeroplane had been seen during the battle. Since then certain
of our squadrons had moved north to the Salient. The
German air force, on the contrary, had been heavily reinforced.
In particular the famous Richthofen, with a squadron
of very fast single-seater scouts, painted bright red,
raged up and down the front, catching many of our comparatively
slow photographic and artillery aeroplanes, and
shooting them down. Another favourite device of his was
to sweep low over our trenches, firing belt after belt upon
the infantry in them, who retorted, without much effect,
by the fire of machine-guns on anti-aircraft mountings.
But his most spectacular feat was undoubtedly the burning
of our balloons. Of these there was a great number on
the front. From Kemmel about fourteen could be counted,
stretching almost to the coast on one side, and perhaps to
Estaires on the other. For men in the neighbourhood of
the hill it became one of the interests of those sunny afternoons
to watch the balloons. The programme was always
of a similar nature. There would be a sudden uproar of
anti-aircraft fire, a fast-moving dot would approach one
of the balloons, two silver dots below the latter would
represent the observers making their way earthwards in their
parachutes. A tiny flicker of fire would appear atop of
the balloon, swiftly growing and spreading. Within a few
seconds the flaming mass would sink slowly. Sometimes
the aggressor would dart straight off to the next balloon in
the line, and repeat the process with that. On the afternoon
of June the 23rd, three balloons in succession were
brought down by one aeroplane. It must, however, have
been displeasing to the Germans to observe how swiftly
every balloon burnt by them was replaced.</p>

<p>The German infantry, it must be added, was entirely
unaggressive, nor was it easy to locate its positions. It
held the ground west of the Canal d'Ypres with isolated
posts, and made no effort to improve the half-dug trenches
already existing. All labour was concentrated upon the
positions east of the Canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th a welcome relief of the 36th by the 37th
Division took place. On the following day the G.O.C.
37th Division took over command of the front, the whole
of the 36th Division, less Artillery, Engineers, and Pioneers,
moving to the Merris area. The Headquarters of the Division
and that of the 108th Brigade were in that village;
the 107th Brigade at Outtersteene, and the 109th at Strazeele.
The batteries, which had withdrawn to their forward
wagon-lines for rest on the 19th, had returned to the line
by the 27th in relief of the 11th Divisional Artillery, and
remained there till July the 5th, under heavy hostile shelling,
in indifferent weather with poor visibility. The Pioneers
and Field Companies had but a day's rest before being
moved to the Salient to begin new work.</p>

<p>The first week of July was given to rest and training
at Merris.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Battle of Langemarck: August 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">On July the 7th the Division, less Artillery, Engineers, and
Pioneers, moved to the training area south-west of St.
Omer, headquarters being established at Wizernes. The
area was considerably smaller than that occupied the previous
summer after the Somme fighting, being in fact the southern
portion of the latter. Billeting accommodation in the
villages was inadequate, and had to be augmented by tents.
Small hardship this in such weather and such surroundings.
Many officers whose lodging was entirely comfortable chose
for preference to sleep in the open air, or in tents in the
cherry orchards. The men were soaked in sunshine. Old
friendships of 1916, and of the early spring, when Brigades
had been training for Messines, were renewed. Fishermen
obtained some excellent trout-fishing. In fact, the Division
probably never had, during all its service in France and
Flanders, a pleasanter period than these twelve days of rest
and training. They ended with a great gymkana at Acquin
on the 23rd, with horse-races, mule-races, jumping, transport
competitions, wrestling on horseback, and sports of all
kinds. A feature of the afternoon was the "divisional drag,"
whipped by Major S. H. Green, the D.A.Q.M.G., with a
team of horses borrowed from Signals, trained and mannered
to a point not unworthy of the Coaching Club, but undoubtedly
on the heavy side&mdash;and the hairy!</p>

<p>On moving to Wizernes the 36th Division had come
under the command of the XIX. Corps, Fifth Army, General
Gough having moved north from Artois for the impending
battle. The Artillery, Engineers, and 16th Rifles had not
shared the good fortune of their comrades. Relieved at
Wytschaete on July the 5th, the former had marched straight
to wagon-lines off the Poperinghe-Ypres Road, coming
under the orders of the C.R.A., 55th Division. By the
night of the 7th one section of each 18-pounder battery
was in action in the northern part of the Salient, on the
Ypres-Poelcappelle Road. A week later all the batteries
were in positions allotted by the 55th Division for the
opening attack, the preliminary bombardment for which
began on the 16th. The Field Companies and Pioneers
moved first to the region about Watou, half-way between
Cassel and Poperinghe, where they were engaged in digging
new wells to improve the water supply for the great numbers
of troops that would be passing through during the
offensive. This was hard work but safe. After three weeks
of it, however, they moved forward, and were henceforth
employed on road repair and the making of cross-country
tracks for men and animals. At this work they suffered
much from shelling, and particularly from gas shell. The
150th Field Company, of its complement of six officers,
had three killed and two wounded within a week; as well
as losing a high proportion of its sappers.</p>

<p>The Division moved up at the end of July in huge brigade
convoys of 'buses and lorries, and by the 30th was in
the back area of the XIX. Corps, between Watou and Poperinghe.
Headquarters were established temporarily in the
latter town at two houses in the rue d'Ypres. The following
morning began the terrible struggle which is generally
known as the third Battle of Ypres.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The great attack launched that morning was the second
stroke of a campaign which had begun triumphantly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Messines. The plans made for 1917 by the Allied Command
had been thrown into some confusion by the retirement
of the German armies on the Somme to their Hindenburg
system, in March, and later by the stopping of General
Nivelle's great offensive in Champagne.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The British had
certainly played their part at Arras and Messines. The
British Command could obviously now not count upon
another great French offensive for some little while, and
it was under the vital necessity of keeping the German
armies heavily engaged. Its greater object was to strike at
the Belgian coast, where the submarine bases of Ostend and
Zeebrugge were becoming a menace so serious to the very
existence of the nation. That scheme has not been made
public, and its details can be no more than a matter of
surmise to any but those in the confidence of the British
Command, or the Imperial General Staff. It will not be
discussed here. It is known, however, pretty generally, that
it involved an attack upon the coast-line and a landing.
Camps had been formed near Dunkirk, surrounded by
barbed wire, where divisions were to be assembled in
greatest secrecy. And as for the attack in the Salient, a
glance at a railway map will show how serious an advance
across the Passchendaele Ridge upon Roulers would have
been to the German communications. A threat to the next
great railway, the main Brussels line between Ghent and
Bruges, would probably have led to the abandonment of
the coast by the enemy. Ludendorff, in mid-July, while
the 36th Division was enjoying its repose in peaceful country,
had made one move in the game&mdash;no more than the move
of a pawn in such a struggle, but a clever and effective one.
At Lombartzyde, outside Nieuport, he had launched an
attack against our troops upon the little slice of ground
held by them north of the Yser Canal, driving them back
into the river. Two divisions had very serious losses, including
over a thousand prisoners, and, worst of all, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"jumping-off" ground for an attack on the coast line had
been snatched away.</p>

<p>Even if they failed in the ambitious venture, the British
could at least hope, beside continuing their policy of
striking blow upon blow at the enemy, to make an end of
the accursed Ypres Salient, and drive the Germans from the
dominating semicircle of higher ground from which they
had so long harassed our troops. Half of this task had
indeed been accomplished by the Battle of Messines. The
southern curve of the Salient had almost disappeared. It
remained to cut away the northern. The great part of the
fighting of Ypres, 1917, was to take place north of the
Zonnebeke Road.</p>

<p>The attack launched on July the 31st by the Fifth Army
of General Gough, and the First French Army of General
Anthoine on his left, met with a considerable measure of
success. At its outset, indeed, the success appeared complete;
but the Germans, holding their positions lightly and
in depth, with the local counter-attack as one of the main
weapons of defence, retook much of the ground won. The
Pilkem spur was, however, in our hands. Great as had
been our losses, the attack upon a position of tremendous
strength had gone well enough for a beginning. But the
weather, so pitiless on the Somme, that had almost startled
pessimists by its unwonted mercy at Messines, broke that
very day. Ere afternoon was over rain began to fall in
torrents. By the following morning the ground, ploughed
up by weeks of shell-fire, was a sea of mud.</p>

<p>The 55th Division, in the fate of which the 36th Division
was particularly interested, since its artillery was supporting
the attack, and its other arms were to relieve their Lancashire
comrades in that sector at a later date, had fared as
well as any other. The troops had gone forward with great
dash and had almost everywhere reached their final objective,
known as the Green Line, east and just south of St.
Julien. The leading battalions had, however, suffered very
heavy loss from the fire of German machine-guns, distributed
in depth, and had not been sufficiently strong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
resist the counter-attack when it came. They were driven
in upon the second objective, or Black Line, which followed,
roughly speaking, the line of the road running south-east
from St. Julien to the farm known as Pommern Castle, in
the Pommern Redoubt.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was an advance of fifteen hundred
yards. To the south affairs had gone less well, and
the Black Line remained to be taken.</p>

<p>It had been the intention of the Commander of the XIX.
Corps to keep the assaulting troops in line after they had
made their attack, till the eve of the next. The result of
the Battle of Langemarck was greatly affected by the fact
that this resolution was not kept. The 55th Division had
suffered so greatly, and its infantry was in a state of such
fatigue, that it was decided to withdraw it at once. The
decision may have been inevitable; on that point the Corps
Commander, General Watts, was alone in a position to form
a judgment. For him and the 36th Division alike, it was
disastrous. It meant that for his next attack he had in his
hands a Division jaded, weary, shaken by deadly shell-fire,
having lost a good third of its infantry strength ere ever it
left its trenches for the assault.</p>

<p>On the morning of August the 2nd, the 107th Brigade
entrained at Poperinghe and detrained at the famous Goldfish
Château, west of Ypres, coming under the orders of the
55th Division, to which it had been allotted as a reserve.
While his Brigade was on the move, General Withycombe
received orders from the 55th Division for it to relieve the
164th Brigade in the old British front-line trenches. The
General reached Wieltje, the Headquarters of the 164th
Brigade, at 12-45 p.m. Three-quarters of an hour later he
received a telegram from the 55th Division ordering a
further relief, that of the much-depleted 165th and 166th
Brigades in the captured German positions. His men had
a long march in heavy rain, and had not completed the
relief of the 164th Brigade till 3-40 p.m. The new relief
was entirely unexpected, and was not in accordance with
the intimation received by General Nugent that his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were to be used as a reserve. It was carried out in continuous
rain, through mud eighteen inches deep, under
heavy fire from howitzers of heavy calibre, and in the midst
of bombing attacks launched against the right flank of the
55th Division. Not till six o'clock on the morning of
August the 3rd was its completion announced. The Brigade
had had heavy casualties, particularly the 10th and
15th Rifles, which had taken over the Black Line. After
that night's work, in fact, there could be no question of
employing those battalions in the coming attack.</p>

<p>That night two battalions of the 108th Brigade, the 13th
Rifles and 9th Irish Fusiliers, relieved the 165th Brigade,
which had moved back to the old British front and support
lines; and two battalions of the 109th Brigade, the 11th
Inniskillings and 14th Rifles, the 166th Brigade; the whole
force under the command of General Withycombe, G.O.C.
107th Brigade, who had his headquarters in the great mined
dug-outs at Wieltje. Divisional Headquarters were established
at Mersey Camp, north of the Poperinghe-Ypres
Road, and about mid-way between the two towns, taking
over command at 4 a.m. on August the 4th. On taking over
the line from the 55th Division, General Nugent decided
that, in view of the dreadful conditions, it might be held
more lightly, and withdrew two of the supporting battalions
to camps about Brandhoek and Vlamertinghe, replacing
them by companies of the supporting battalions of the 107th
Brigade. There were other reliefs during the period of
waiting, all the battalions having a turn, though the six
which were to lead over on August the 16th were saved as
much as might be. The headquarters of the Brigades also
took turn about in command of the line, in the filth and
stenches of Wieltje dug-outs.</p>

<p>Wieltje dug-outs! Who that saw it will forget that
abominable mine, with its "town major," its thirteen entrances,
the water that flowed down its main passages and
poured down its walls, its electric light gleaming dully
through steam-coated lamps, its sickly atmosphere, its
smells, its huge population of men&mdash;and of rats? From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
behind sack-curtained doorways the coughing and groaning
of men in uneasy slumber mingled with the click of typewriters.
In the corridor one would fall over a runner,
slimy from head to foot with mud, resting while he waited
for a return message to the front line. One advantage only
it had: it was safe within. And that was in part counterbalanced
by the danger of exit and entrance, constantly
menaced by storms of fire. The cross-country tracks,
simply paths from which wire had been cleared, behind it,
were more horrible still. Their object was to allow troops
and pack animals&mdash;even the shells for the field artillery had
to go forward by pack&mdash;to avoid roads under constant shell-fire.
But the Germans now knew them every whit as well
as the roads, and shelled them all day with every calibre
up to 8-inch howitzers. No one who used them but had
at some point to lie crouched on his belly, watching huge
columns of earth and water spout up with the burst of the
big shells. Horrors were not new, nor did the sight of
dead bodies affect men overmuch, but there was one vision
upon one of these tracks, the mangled remains of a complete
party of artillery carriers, six men and twelve horses, which
burnt itself upon the brains of those that saw it.</p>

<p>The war had in those days reached its worst stage. Gas
shelling and aeroplane bombing were at their height. The
infantry resting in the camps between Vlamertinghe and
Elverdinghe had to endure, night after night, the crashing
of great bombs among the huts and tents. The casualties
to horses were very high, a horse being ten times as vulnerable
as a man to bombs. The Casualty Clearing Stations
probably suffered higher losses than in any other battle of
the war. The counter-battery work was ferocious on both
sides. For our batteries there was little concealment, and
for their guns and teams little shelter. The gunners of the
36th Division, who had been in action at the opening of
the Battle of Langemarck for over a month, suffered from
strain and discomfort perhaps even more severely than the
infantry on this occasion. And, day after day, fell the
rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In the trenches the mud and the artillery fire were the
most serious foes. The German infantry could easily be
held. There was one counter-attack on the 8th, on the
extreme left. Our bombing squads moved up and drove
the enemy out. On the 10th the II. Corps on the right
attacked to establish itself upon the Black Line, the artillery
covering the 36th Division co-operating. The attack
was in the main successful, and the way was prepared for
a further advance. On the night of the 14th the troops of
the 107th Brigade, then in front line, were relieved, and
those which were to carry out the attack moved up, picking
up their bombs and special equipment at battle stores previously
established as far forward as possible, past which
the platoons moved slowly in single file.</p>

<p>The final objective of the 36th Division was from a
point on the Zonnebeke-Langemarck Road near Gallipoli
Copse, on the right, to Aviatik Farm on the left. This
was represented by a series of strong concrete forts, and
known as the Red Line. The 16th Division was attacking
on the right and the 48th Division on the left of the 36th.
The attack of the 36th Division was to be made by the
108th Brigade on the right and the 109th Brigade on the
left, with the 107th Brigade in reserve. Each Brigade was
to attack with two battalions in front line, one in support,
about a thousand yards in rear, and one in reserve, in the
old British front and support lines. Each battalion was to
attack on a two-company front, in four waves. The second
and fourth waves were to be only half the strength of the
first and third, owing to companies having been reduced
for the time being to three platoons. The objective of the
leading companies was the line Gallipoli-Schuler Farm,
the old Green Line of the first offensive, still so-called.
On this line the rear companies were to pass through to
the final objective, the original leading companies following
in close support. The supporting battalions were then to
move up and take over the Green Line. A company from
each of the supporting battalions was allotted to the leading
two battalions on each brigade front as "moppers up."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Special platoons were given as their objectives such concrete
strongholds as Somme, Pond Farm, Hindu Cott, Green
House, Schuler Farm. Four guns of each of the Machine-Gun
Companies of the attacking brigades were to go forward
with the infantry, the remainder being used for the
barrage. No Stokes mortars could be taken forward owing
to the state of the ground. The task of the R.E. was the
consolidation of the Dotted Green Line. This was to be
a defensive system on our side of the wire running from
Gallipoli Copse through Green House, using that obstacle
for our own purposes. That of the Pioneers was the clearance
of the Wieltje-Gravenstafel Road.</p>

<p>The field artillery, under the orders of General Brock,
the C.R.A., consisted of the 36th and 61st Divisional Artilleries
and the 108th and 150th Army Field Artillery Brigades.
For the creeping barrage there were fourteen
18-pounder batteries, giving, as at Messines, about one gun
to twenty yards. There were four 18-pounder batteries for
distant barrage, to search hidden ground, and deal with
strong points beyond the creeping barrage, while the six
4.5 howitzer batteries fired a hundred yards ahead of the
latter, resting on all known strong points and machine-gun
emplacements. The pace of the barrage was a hundred
yards in five minutes, with a pause of thirty-five minutes
in front of the Green Line. This seems as slow as could
well be, but events were to prove that it was too fast in the
conditions. There were three gas-shell bombardments prior
to the attack, the last being on the night of the 15th, "Y/Z"
night. For these there was allotted a hundred rounds per
18-pounder and fifty rounds per howitzer. One section of
tanks was to take part in the attack, but there was at no
time a probability of tanks reaching our front line. Zero
was at 4-45 a.m.</p>

<p>There was very heavy shelling of the assembly trenches
and the roads in rear during the night of the 15th. A small
dug-out occupied by the headquarters of the 14th Rifles
near Spree Farm was hit repeatedly, and it was impossible
to keep alight a candle inside it. So excellent, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was the German concrete, that it held out. Between midnight
and 2-30 a.m. the four leading battalions must have
suffered on an average fifty casualties apiece.</p>

<p>The story of the attack, alas! is not a long one. The
German barrage came down swiftly, but, as it was for the
most part on the assembly trenches and behind them, it
had small effect upon the leading waves. But enemy
machine-guns all along the front opened fire almost simultaneously
with our barrage. Gallipoli, Somme, Aisne
House, Hindu Cott, Schuler Farm, Border House, and
Jew's Hill, were held in strength by the enemy. The concrete
"pill-boxes," containing in some cases half a dozen
separate compartments, seemed to be entirely unaffected by
the pounding of many weeks. Moreover, strong wire entanglements
running down obliquely from Gallipoli were
encountered. The lanes cut by artillery fire were covered
by machine-guns. The ground was a veritable quagmire.
The "mopping-up" system was found to be impossible.
The concrete works had to be fought for; they could not
be passed by and left to "moppers up" in rear. The
inevitable result was that the men quickly lost the barrage.
The strength of the attacking force had become inadequate
to its frontage of one thousand five hundred yards. So
heavily had the battalions lost since the Division took over
the line, and particularly during the last twenty-four hours
in the trenches, that seventy men was about the average
strength of the company. There were assuredly not two
thousand infantrymen in the force which went "over the
top." The foremost wave must have consisted of less than
three hundred men, probably reduced to a third within half
a minute. Not unfitting was the description of a sergeant
who took part in the attack: "It looked more like a big
raiding party than anything else."</p>

<p>In the circumstances, after what they had endured, with
ranks so thinned, against such opposition, it may be said,
without calling upon superlatives or high-flown words, that
none but troops of excellent quality would have gone forward
at all. The troops of the 36th Division did much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
more than this. On the extreme right the 9th Irish Fusiliers,
attacking from the Pommern Redoubt, pressed up
across Hill 35, driving the Germans before them from the
gun-pits on its forward slope. The 13th Rifles on their
left advanced equally well. Somme, one of the strongest
forts on the front, was passed by the leading wave, but the
platoon detailed to take and hold it was unable to do so,
though the rifle-grenade section strove gallantly to work
round and take it in flank. The adjutant, Captain Belt,
made an attempt to dig in in front of the place with a handful
of men, but was severely wounded and fortunate in
being able to crawl back to our lines. On the right of the
36th Division, the 16th had at first made good progress,
but a counter-attack drove its troops back to their original
line. From six o'clock onwards men began to fall back.
Colonel R. P. Maxwell, commanding the 13th, seeing
what was happening, led forward his battalion headquarters
to a desperate attack upon Somme. He was
unsuccessful, being himself severely wounded. It will
be remembered that Colonel Maxwell, who had two sons
on active service, had been wounded in Martinsart on
the eve of the Somme attack. He was to reappear, none
the less, in France in 1918. Colonel Somerville, commanding
the 9th Irish Fusiliers, had already been mortally
wounded. With the failure of Colonel Maxwell's forlorn
hope, it may be said that the attack on the front of the 108th
Brigade collapsed, though the 9th Irish Fusiliers made an
effort to cling to the top of Hill 35.</p>

<p>On the right of the 109th Brigade, the 14th Rifles had to
cross ground far worse even than the ordinary, completely
under water, in fact. In their passage they came under
withering machine-gun fire from Pond Farm. Lieutenant
Ledlie made a fine attempt to capture this place, surrounding
it on three sides with the few men remaining to him when
he reached it, and killing any Germans who showed themselves.
With his numbers so greatly depleted, he waited
for support before making an attempt to rush it, sending
back two messages. But no supports came; the men could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
not face the machine-gun fire. They had already suffered
greatly from the artillery barrage, which the leading waves
had avoided. At eight o'clock, seeing that his position was
hopeless, he withdrew his men a hundred and fifty yards,
covering his retirement by Lewis-gun fire. The best work
of the day was accomplished by the men of the 11th Inniskillings.
They also had heaviest casualties on the right,
where a mere fragment was left glued to the ground in
front of the Green Line, the men crawling in to our line
after dark. On the left the usual blast of fire came from
Border House and Fort Hill. One officer and seven men,
by doubling when they fell behind the barrage, reached the
Green Line, but none could move up to their support, and
they were compelled to withdraw. The men of the supporting
companies rushed Fort Hill with bomb and bayonet,
killing a number of Germans and taking some prisoners.
This was the one appreciable gain, an advance on the extreme
left of some four hundred yards. The 48th Division
had not been able to accomplish even as much on the flank.
From Fort Hill a rough line to the original position in Capricorn
Keep was consolidated. The reserve battalions of each
Brigade, the 12th Rifles on the right and the 10th Inniskillings
on the left, had moved up to the Black Line, where
officers busied themselves in reorganizing the men and
making preparations for a possible counter-attack by the
enemy. The latter may have had such intention. He was
at least observed to reinforce his position strongly behind
Pond Farm. On an S.O.S. rocket being sent up, our barrage
fell upon his platoons moving up at this point, and
scattered them with heavy loss.</p>

<p>General Nugent for a time contemplated a second attack
with a new barrage, to take at least the Green Line. The
reports of Brigadiers and Staff Officers visiting the line in
the afternoon made it clear that the troops were in no fit
state for any such attempt. Disorganization was still considerable;
a high proportion of officers and N.C.O.'s had
fallen, and the men were utterly exhausted. Moreover,
neither the 108th nor the 109th Brigade could have mustered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
five hundred men for a new attack. General Nugent accordingly
decided against this course, and instead ordered
the relief of the two attacking Brigades by the 107th that
night. This was carried out in circumstances of great
difficulty, some platoons not quitting the front line till after
five o'clock next morning. The weary remnants were
moved straight back by 'bus to Winnizeele, and that night
a Brigade of the 61st Division relieved the 107th Brigade
in the line.</p>

<p>It is impossible to arrive at the exact casualties during
the hours of the actual assault. Between 6 a.m. on the
16th and 9 a.m. on the 18th, however, there passed through
the Divisional Dressing Stations 58 officers and 1,278 other
ranks, wounded or gassed. These casualties do not include
those of the attached artillery. They are very high if the
depleted state of the infantry prior to the attack be taken
into consideration. But they are almost insignificant if
compared with the total casualties suffered in the holding
of the line in the Salient, from August the 2nd to the 18th.
In that period the 36th Division lost 144 officers and 3,441
other ranks killed, wounded, or missing. That is to say,
it had more than two thousand casualties ere launched
to the attack. Two other commanding officers, besides
Colonels Somerville and Maxwell, were among the casualties.
Colonel A. C. Pratt, 11th Inniskillings, had been
killed at the entrance to Wieltje dug-outs early on the morning
of the 16th, while Colonel Macrory, 10th Inniskillings,
had been severely wounded a few days earlier. The difficulties
of evacuating wounded during the action were extraordinary.
Stretcher cases had to be brought by hand
at least two thousand yards, and it took eight men to each
stretcher. There were 433 stretcher-bearers, of whom
rather more than half were R.A.M.C., the remainder being
men of a Tunnelling Company and the Divisional Salvage
section. Among many who displayed great bravery in the
work of evacuating wounded under heavy shell-fire was
the Assistant Chaplain-General of the Division, the Rev.
F. J. Halahan, M.C., who by precept and personal example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
encouraged the stretcher-bearers to new efforts. Search
parties, sent out after dark, brought in about a hundred
wounded men from in front of our line. The conduct of
the medical officers with the battalions, tending their
wounded under the very heavy shell-fire that was maintained
throughout upon the Black Line, was beyond praise. Captain
Gavin, R.A.M.C., attached to the 14th Rifles, did
splendid work at Rat Farm, where two other medical officers
were killed. This gallant officer, who earned a bar to his
Military Cross on that occasion, and had escapes little short
of miraculous, was to be killed a few months later by no
more serious an accident than a fall from his horse.</p>

<p>Among those good dumb soldiers, the transport animals,
the casualties were the highest ever suffered by the Division.
The pack mules, the use of which was even more
necessary than at Messines, but infinitely less favoured by
the <em>terrain</em>, were pushed forward too soon, and came under
heavy machine-gun fire. Many were killed, and a far greater
number had to be destroyed, though a few survived their
wounds, and, like gallant veterans, bore their scars till the
war was over. The loss among artillery horses was also
very great.</p>

<p>This action was the only attack made by the 36th Division
which suffered complete reverse, for that on the Ancre
had been a local victory, of which the fruits were lost through
no fault of its troops. It is important to consider what
were its causes and what its lessons.</p>

<p>Many of the former will have become apparent in the
course of this sketch of the battle and of the days preceding.
They may be summarized as, firstly, exhaustion and attrition
of units; secondly, weather; thirdly, lack of essential
preparation.</p>

<p>The Division had been holding the line for thirteen
days. Owing to the dreadful state of the trenches and the
heaviness of the German shell-fire, constant reliefs had been
necessary. From the "resting" battalions parties totalling
sometimes as much as a thousand men a day had been
furnished for work on forward areas under constant fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
from artillery of the highest calibres. Apart from the
question of the huge losses, there were no troops really fit or
in a normal state of efficiency when the day of the assault
arrived. The personal equation had been overlooked, with
disastrous results. The water-logged condition of the
ground was another prominent factor. What it was only
those who have seen the Flanders plain strewn with shell-holes,
sometimes almost lip to lip, can imagine.</p>

<p>But it was the machine-guns in the "pill-boxes," and
the excellent fashion in which they were defended, that
were by far the most fatal obstacles. The new German
methods of defence in depth depended, in Flanders, upon
the concrete structures built in and around the foundations
of the destroyed farms with which that countryside is
studded. They served their purpose admirably. Few that
were captured by us were found to have been damaged
by artillery. The British heavy artillery was firing from a
salient, instead of, as at Messines, upon a salient. It had
against it a far greater weight of German metal than in that
battle, and suffered far more heavily from counter-battery.
The German artillery dominated ours in the early stages of
the battle, certainly in position, probably also in actual gun-power.
The observation of the latter was almost worthless.
And where any could be obtained it was well-nigh impossible
to identify the "pill-boxes" from map to ground.
An instance given by the G.O.C. 109th Brigade, General
Ricardo, is illuminating. A few days prior to the attack
he arranged with a liaison officer from the Corps Heavy
Artillery a series of three-minute bombardments of certain
strong points, with pauses between, so that it should be
clear to the observers exactly which was being shelled, to
correct the many various readings of maps and photographs.
In several cases, he states, the concentration, nominally
upon one strong point, covered many hundred yards. The
same considerations applied to the cutting of wire, not
nearly so effective as at Messines, through no fault of the
gunners of the Division and of the batteries working beside
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The "pill-boxes," which were mainly responsible for the
losses of the troops in the attack of July the 31st, were standing
intact and garrisoned on the 16th of August. The
claims of counter-battery sometimes prevented demands for
re-bombardment being fully met.</p>

<p>"We felt," said a distinguished officer after the action,
"that the Battle of Messines was won at Zero, and that the
Battle of Ypres was lost long before it." In the vast armies
of the late war the Army Commander, and even the Corps
Commander, was a shadowy personage, not alone to the
private soldier, but to the Colonel commanding a battalion
in the trenches or a brigade of artillery behind them. But
the Second Army and the IX. Corps, under the orders of
which the 36th Division fought at Messines, had a subtle
power of making their presence felt. The system of liaison
was practised by the Second Army as in no other. General
Harington's car stopped at every door, and the cheerful
young staff officers, who knew every communication trench
on the Army front, who drank with company commanders
in their front-line dug-outs before coming back to tea with
a Brigadier, or with General Nugent at his Headquarters,
formed a very real link between the Higher Command and
the troops. The private soldier knew the Army Commander
and his eyeglass as he knew no Corps Commander
under whom he fought. His personality was a real accretion
of strength. The difficulties at Ypres were infinitely
greater than at Messines; that everyone recognised. But
in the former case they did not appear to be met with quite
the precision, care, and forethought of the latter. The
private soldier felt a difference. He may have been unfair
in his estimate, but that estimate was none the less of importance.
For what the private soldier felt had a marked
effect upon what the private soldier, the only ultimate winner
of battles, accomplished.</p>

<p>Of the lessons the most obvious was that the barrage
must be slower and of greater depth. General Nugent, in
notes written after the battle as a comment upon captured
orders of the Fourth German Army, made some interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
suggestions in this regard. He stated in the first case that
the Germans could now no longer shell the area over which
our troops were advancing, since their own troops were
distributed in depth upon it. However much damage their
barrage did to our supports, it did little or none to the leading
troops. It was, however, more important to facilitate
the advance of the latter than to protect the rear area during
an attack. If both could not be accomplished, the artillery
covering the front of assault should be strengthened at the
expense of counter-battery groups. The creeping barrage,
he suggested, might be slightly reduced to one 18-pounder
per twenty-five yards, and augmented by a sweeping barrage,
concentrated to cover about ten yards a gun, each group
sweeping right and left along the front allotted to it, with
a higher burst and greater searching effect upon shell-holes.
The pace of the creeping barrage must be reduced, and
there must be more frequent pauses. During these the
sweeping barrage and a 60-pounder barrage in front of it
might sweep and search. He also made some remarks upon
the possibility of control of the barrage by the infantry, the
advantages of which are too obvious to merit discussion,
and the difficulties of which are equally apparent.</p>

<p>But the most interesting of General Nugent's suggestions
were with regard to the formations of the infantry.
"With the adoption," he wrote, "of a new form of German
defensive tactics, consisting of small parties dotted about
a wide area, the disadvantages of long lines of attack are
that lines have small manœuvring capacity and lack depth.
It is for consideration whether mobile company columns
echeloned in depth on a narrow front, each a self-contained
tactical unit with a machine-gun and trench mortar, each
operating within an allotted zone, would not be a more
suitable tactical formation than the present system, which
breaks up under machine-gun fire and in badly shelled
ground into a number of isolated groups without cohesion
or leaders."</p>

<p>It is to be noted that when, on September the 20th, the
9th (Scottish) Division attacked at Frezenberg, the creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
barrage advanced the first two hundred yards in eight minutes;
then slowed to a hundred yards in six minutes;
halted on the first objective&mdash;four to five hundred yards&mdash;no
less than an hour, and went forward again at the snail
pace of a hundred yards in eight minutes. As regards the
infantry, the attack was carried out by lines of sections in
file at about twenty yards' interval. The system of "leap-frogging"
was also employed instead of special groups for
"mopping up." This attack was a complete success.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Ypres to Cambrai: September to November 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Having once more left its Artillery and Pioneers in line,
under the orders of another division, the 36th Division,
after four days' rest about Winnizeele, moved south by
train. The troops detrained at Bapaume and Miraumont,
ruins now, upon the church steeples of which some of them
had looked from the Mesnil Ridge a little over a year before.
With the Division moved the 1st Battalion Royal Irish
Fusiliers. This regular battalion had joined the Division
in the Salient before the Battle of Langemarck, but had
not taken part in that dolorous affair. Its arrival was highly
significant. It was a sign of the shortage of recruits from
home. The 36th Division had not been made up to strength
between Messines and Langemarck, and was now deplorably
below it.</p>

<p>The country into which the troops stepped from their
trains was of a like they had not yet seen in all their active
service. Behind them lay the "shelled" area; that in
which they now stood was the "devastated" area. The
former was featureless to an indescribable degree. Marks
of battle there were few, save for the stumps of trees. All
the countryside, its débris and its shell-holes, was covered
with a mass of very coarse grass. There were not even
ruins, for buildings had been blown flat and their rubble
carted away to help maintain the excellent main roads with
which the area was now traversed. It was hard to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the sites even of villages. Most people who used the Albert-Bapaume
Road will remember a wooden cross whereon was
written: "This is the site of Le Sars Church." For that
statement it was necessary to take the writer's word. There
was no other evidence.</p>

<p>The devastated area, on the other hand, had not been
fought upon. It represented the ground evacuated by the
enemy in his retreat to the Hindenburg Line. It had,
however, been cleared of civilians and scientifically demolished
to make it as difficult and comfortless as possible
for our troops. All houses had been blown up by explosives,
bridges destroyed, fruit-trees cut down or gashed
to death. Yet it was far from being as dreadful or as ugly
as the battle-field. The ground was unbroken and covered
with good grass or crop run to seed. There were still
woods and copses. It was depressing, yet far less so than
the Salient. It resembled primeval prairie, and the hutments
springing up here and there might have been the
encampments of bold pioneers.</p>

<p>Between the 28th and 30th of August the Division relieved
the 9th (Scottish) Division in the line. The right
boundary was marked by a communication trench, "Queen
Lane," on the Beaucamp-Ribécourt Road, a thousand yards
north of the former village; the left was on the Demicourt-Graincourt
Road. The frontage was very considerable,
upwards of six thousand yards in a straight line. All three
Brigades were in line, the 107th on the right, in what was
known as the Trescault sector; the 108th in the centre,
in the Havrincourt sector; and the 109th Brigade on the
left, in the Hermies sector. The men of the Scottish Division
made a very good impression upon their comrades of the
36th by working on their trenches till the moment of relief.
As the troops of the 107th Brigade filed up the long communication
trenches they saw the men of the 9th Division's
South African Brigade carrying up the last sacks of chalk
from the deep dug-outs under construction. It was a
friendly gesture, typical of the good sportmanship of this
fine Division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an interesting and remarkable front that was
taken over by the 36th Division. Its principal feature was
the Canal du Nord, designed to link up the Canal de la
Sensée with the Canal de la Somme at Peronne. The
Canal du Nord had been about half completed at the outbreak
of war. It ran due south to the northern skirts of
Havrincourt Wood, the height from its bottom to the ground
level varying from fifteen to a hundred feet, dry where it
crossed the Bapaume-Cambrai Road, but with a few feet
of water in it further south. North of Havrincourt Wood
it turned west along the Grand Ravin, then south again,
disappearing at Ruyalcourt, and reappearing a couple of
miles further on north of Etricourt. Just at the destroyed
railway bridge between Hermies and Havrincourt it formed
a barrier between British and German.</p>

<p>The other important feature was the Hindenburg system
of trenches, two great lines, from five hundred to two thousand
yards apart, each consisting of front and support
trenches. The system constituted in all probability the
most formidable fortification constructed in the course of
the war. The Germans had sited and dug it at their ease,
to a great extent with gangs of Russian prisoners and forced
civilian labour. The trenches were wide, deep, and well
revetted. The mined dug-outs were all designed to a
pattern; the stairways, supports, and all timber used in
them having been turned out by the sawmills in replica
by the thousand pieces. They represented the first successful
application of mass production to the construction
of dug-outs. The wire defences were of huge extent,
generally in three or four deep belts, at least twenty feet
apart. The system had already been pierced by our troops
at Bullecourt, but on a tiny front and at vast cost. It appeared
practically impregnable.</p>

<p>From the village of Mœuvres the front system of the
Hindenburg Line<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> followed the western bank of the Canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
du Nord for four thousand yards, then crossed it, sweeping
in a bold curve round the village of Havrincourt and south
of that of Ribécourt. It did not, however, represent by
any means the line held by the German outposts, which
were in general a thousand yards in advance of it, and frequently
in themselves stout and well-wired positions. Along
the banks of the Canal du Nord there were at intervals
spoil heaps, consisting of the chalk dug from its bed. Of
these, two were of great importance to the Division. The
northern spoil heap was on the front of the 109th Brigade,
on the west bank of the Canal. Sixty feet in height, it
was strongly wired and had machine-guns mounted on its
flat top which swept our trenches. The southern spoil
heap was smaller, at the sharp bend west of Havrincourt,
where the Canal turned westward along the Grand Ravin.
It was known as Yorkshire Bank. There was a British
trench on the top of it, but on its eastern rim the Germans
had established posts, rather unaccountably in view of the
aggressive character of the troops of the 9th Division. They,
too, seemed to feel that such a legacy to a relieving division
was unworthy their fame. On the night of August the 30th,
before General Nugent had taken over command of the
front, a party of Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, advancing
after the German part of the spoil heap had been
shelled with gas, drove out the enemy piquets and established
posts of their own. The 9th Division, therefore,
was able to leave an honourable legacy here after all, but a
peculiarly lively one. Next evening, after General Nugent
had taken over the command and established his headquarters
in Little Wood, outside the village of Ytres, the
Germans hit back. After a bombardment of Yorkshire
Bank, they drove in our posts and re-established their own.
At 4-15 a.m. next morning they were re-ejected. Next
night they came again, two parties bombing their way up
simultaneously from either side. At 1 a.m. on the 2nd the
12th Rifles retook the posts, with bomb and Lewis gun.
That evening at dusk an officer visiting the posts saw Germans
looking over the edge of the bank. They were rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
immediately and driven out, leaving a wounded prisoner.
Two nights later they tried yet again, with typical German
persistence. A shower of bombs from the top of the spoil
heap drove them off, and as they were retreating a shell
from a Stokes mortar was seen to drop in the centre of a
group. One other attempt was made, to meet with like
decisive failure. It was not an important affair, though it
caused the name of Yorkshire Bank to appear in the British
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> three days running. The 36th Division had
had the better of the exchanges, but did not unduly pride
itself thereon, having a manifest advantage in position.</p>

<p>For the rest, the area was rolling, well watered, and
fairly thickly wooded. In the big Havrincourt Wood, which
had originally covered some four square miles, the Germans
had cut down much timber and used it on the Hindenburg
trenches, besides leaving a great many trees lying on the
ground. It still contained enough, however, to afford excellent
cover. The Hindenburg System was admirably
sited, and afforded to the enemy good observation of the
area held by us, particularly from the dark mass of Bourlon
Wood, crowning the height of the hundred-metre contour
north of the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. In such country as
this, however, it was impossible for the Germans to deny
to us all the good ground. From the Hermies Ridge, from
trees in Havrincourt Wood, from the very front line on
the Trescault spur, the British had admirable views of their
positions. Very tantalizing they were to men who dwelt
among ruins, for the villages on the German side were intact,
save for the nearest, which had been slightly damaged
by our shell-fire. Very distinct from one point, and little
more than eight miles off, were the steeples and roofs of
the beautiful city of Cambrai.</p>

<p>There was a striking contrast between the trenches in
the Trescault and Havrincourt sectors, and those in the
northern or Hermies sector. The former consisted of a
whole series of lines, so many trenches that they had to
be occupied and defended at intervals only, by a system of
"localities," each manned in general by a platoon. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
trenches had, in fact, been prepared in the spring for assembly
with view to an offensive which did not eventuate.
In the Hermies sector, on the contrary, there were practically
no defences at all, save a shadowy front line and some
trenches round the village. This northern sector had been
held by the 27th Brigade of the 9th Division, commanded
by the celebrated Brigadier-General F. A. Maxwell, V.C.,
who was killed in the Salient shortly after his Division had
moved north. He, apparently, was not a believer in
trenches, and relied on holding his position by counter-attack
from the Hermies defences and from behind the
high ridge along which ran the Hermies-Demicourt Road.
The plan did not appeal to General Nugent or to General
Ricardo, commanding the 109th Brigade, and a heavy programme
of trench-digging and wiring in the Hermies sector
was at once drawn up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the Salient, the Artillery and 16th Rifles
endured a bitter period. Indeed, it is to be doubted whether
any Divisional Artillery, since the second Battle of Ypres in
1915, had been subjected to strain such as that which now fell
to the lot of the 36th Division's gunners. They had gone into
action on July the 14th, in support of the 55th Division. They
remained in action after the 36th Division had departed,
and on August the 21st supported an unsuccessful attack by
the 61st Division on the same front. They were not relieved
till the night of the 23rd. And these six weeks had
represented battle conditions in their worst form, a huge
expenditure of ammunition, heavy and continuous hostile
counter-battery, shelling of wagon-lines, the scantiest of
accommodation, mud and indescribable wretchedness. A
great proportion of the personnel had disappeared, new
officers were commanding sections and junior officers batteries,
when they detrained at the end of August at Bapaume.
The lot of the Pioneers was not quite so hard,
but their period in the Salient was longer. Two companies
worked on the ruins of the infantry barracks at Ypres, the
remainder on screening the Menin Road, on a trench tramway
to Railway Wood, on the construction of strong points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on the Westhoek Ridge, and like tasks, till September the
30th, when the battalion was entrained at Vlamertinghe and
sent to rejoin the Division.</p>

<p>The line now held by the Division was on the whole
the pleasantest it had ever known. This does not imply
that the troops were allowed to take life easily. On the
contrary, the fighting arms displayed considerable aggression,
with important results. The German methods of
defence, with outposts far in front of the main Hindenburg
System, not always very strongly defended, and sometimes
held at night only, offered considerable opportunity for those
little silent raids upon isolated piquets which the Canadians
had perfected, and knew by the expressive term "winkling."
The first affair was on a scale rather bigger than this implies,
parties of about sixty being engaged on either side. The
scene was Wigan Copse, north of Yorkshire Bank, and the
result the retirement of the Germans, leaving a wounded
prisoner in the hands of the 12th Rifles, who had an officer and
four men slightly wounded. That was on October the 6th.
Three days later, at dusk, the 10th Rifles cut the wire of
a post on the edge of the eastern arm of Havrincourt Wood,
known as Fémy Wood, waited for the garrison to arrive,
captured its leader, a corporal, and killed the remaining ten.
On the 23rd, a party of the 11th Rifles, covering work on
our wire, made a neat capture of six men who approached
it, closing in on them from either flank, and taking them
without a shot fired. Another prisoner was captured by
the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers, now in the 107th Brigade,
when one of its saps north of Trescault was unsuccessfully
attacked by the enemy. Various other deserters and single
wanderers were also taken from time to time. On the British
side was one minor disaster. A patrol of one officer
and nine other ranks of the 1st Irish Fusiliers, examining
the results of trench mortar fire on the German wire, was
ambushed by a party of about thirty Germans. After
heavy fighting, in which they inflicted numerous casualties
on the enemy, the Fusiliers were forced to withdraw, three
wounded men being captured. But the most heroic of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
these little episodes was when a party of Germans approached
a sap-head held by a section of four men of the
15th Rifles, calling out in English: "It's all right. We're
coming to visit you." Deceived by the ruse, the Riflemen's
first warning was a shower of bombs, which wounded one
of them. At the same moment the Germans jumped into
the sap. The three remaining Riflemen might well have
been excused had they retreated down the sap. Instead,
upon the instant, they charged the enemy with the bayonet.
The Germans ran, but the plucky defenders laid hands
upon one that they had wounded, and kept him. The
prisoner stated that his party had consisted of an officer
and eight men. And at dawn the body of that officer, dead
from a bayonet wound, was found outside the sap-head. It
was in truth a gallant exploit.</p>

<p>In two or three other cases our men were unsuccessful
in entering posts, finding the enemy on the alert. One
raid only on a big scale was carried out, on the trenches
south of the Hermies-Havrincourt Road and east of the
Canal. At 7-30 p.m. on November the 3rd, three parties
of the 9th Irish Fusiliers, numbering in all, with stretcher-bearers
and sappers, four officers and sixty-seven other
ranks, moved out from Yorkshire Bank and passed through
gaps in the German wire. They then sent up a red flare,
which brought down a heavy barrage on all approaches.
The raid would have been a complete success had not the
right party come upon some wire repaired by the Germans
since it had been reported destroyed by our artillery. Eventually
they stormed the obstacle and cut down the defenders,
but not without heavy loss to themselves. Our total casualties
were one man killed, three missing, believed killed, and
one officer and fourteen men wounded. The Germans
were estimated to have had forty killed. Had the men, for
the most part newly transferred troopers of the North Irish
Horse, not been more eager to kill than to capture, a considerable
number of prisoners might have been taken.</p>

<p>Among other offensive methods employed must be recorded
a new horror of war, the Livens projector, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the troops of the 36th Division now saw for the first time.
It was simply a large steel drum filled with lethal gas, under
compression, fired from a short tube. Its range was upwards
of two thousand yards. Six hundred of these mortars
were dug in at the bend of the Canal, and on the night of
the 14th of September fired into Havrincourt. It was definitely
established by the evidence of prisoners captured the
following month that the losses in the village were very
heavy. The battalion which held it had to be relieved that
night. In two dug-outs alone twenty men were killed by
the gas.</p>

<p>The artillery also was active. The ammunition allotment
was high. It was, indeed, the huge increase in the
supply of 18-pounder ammunition that had made really
"quiet bits" almost unknown upon the British front. For
when the British had ammunition they fired it off. The
French, on the other hand, on a quiet front, preferred to
live quiet lives. The IV. Corps ordered that two-thirds of
the allotment should be expended at night, in harassing fire
upon roads. As most of our batteries had little flash-cover,
such shooting betrayed gun positions. Recourse was therefore
had to single guns for night-firing, pushed forward at
dusk and withdrawn before dawn. Some of these forward
guns had an unpleasant reception. One was destroyed by
accurate enemy fire. The Germans, for their part, paid
greater attention to our batteries than to our trenches. Their
favourite method, which the 36th Division had experienced
in Flanders, was a deliberate "shooting-up" of a single
battery, beginning with aeroplane observation, and continued
by the aid of high shrapnel bursts, which could be
"spotted," for five or six hours at the rate of about a round
a minute. These bombardments did some damage and
caused some loss to the gunners, but the latter had more
than once the satisfaction of drawing fire upon dummy or
abandoned positions, while those in use went scatheless.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the arrival of the 1st
Irish Fusiliers from the 4th Division. This battalion was,
on August the 27th, posted to the 107th Brigade. To make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
place for it two other battalions of that Brigade, the 8th
and 9th Rifles, were amalgamated, becoming the 8th/9th
Royal Irish Rifles. It was a sad occasion, above all for such
officers and other ranks of these original battalions as still
survived with them. It meant the end, or well-nigh the
end, of a cherished tradition. The next arrivals were over
three hundred all ranks of the North Irish Horse, a regiment
of which had been dismounted. This large draft was
posted to the 9th Irish Fusiliers, thereafter officially known
as the 9th (North Irish Horse) Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers.
Then came the 7th Irish Rifles from the 16th Division,
and a regular battalion, the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles,
from the 25th Division. The 7th Battalion, of a total
strength of less than four hundred all ranks, was broken
up, and its personnel transferred to the 2nd. The latter
was then posted to the 108th Brigade, while to make place
for it the 11th and 13th Rifles were amalgamated, becoming
the 11th/13th Royal Irish Rifles. In each case surplus personnel
was drafted to the remaining battalions of the 107th
and 108th Brigades, which were now over strength. The
109th Brigade, which received considerable reinforcements
during the month of September, was little below it.</p>

<p>The work of the 36th Division in this area almost
equalled that of Flanders. The "localities" in the front
line trenches soon resembled model fortifications, such as
might have been made for the instruction of an engineering
school. Curving round the village of Hermies, the Pioneers
dug perhaps the best trench ever made in entirety by the
Division, which was christened in their honour "Lurgan
Switch." The best deep dug-outs the Division had ever
known, with thirty feet of cover, were dug in the chalk
under the instruction of the Field Companies, now no mean
experts in such work. Here, too, what were known from
their shape as "champagne" dug-outs were constructed,
on a pattern invented by that artist in trench warfare, the
enemy. In these the team of a single machine-gun could
shelter from the heaviest bombardment, and bring its gun
into action in the time it took two men to run up a ladder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Behind the lines work was equally hard. In such country
as this, with not a solitary house standing, the troops had
no other accommodation than that which they constructed
for themselves. This was the land of the "Nissen" hut,
too well known even to people who never saw the Front
to merit description here. They sprang up everywhere,
these ugly but useful buildings, with their arched roofs of
corrugated iron. Excellent Divisional Headquarters were
built in Ytres, to replace those in Little Wood. Fine new
Brigade Headquarters appeared in Neuville and Bertincourt,
to which the two northern Brigades moved back
from unsafe and uncomfortable headquarters further forward.
Bertincourt represented perhaps the best example of
scientific work upon a ruined village. It was parcelled out
between the various units, each being allotted its own section,
on which no other might encroach. General Ricardo
offered prizes for the best designed and best kept billets.
Under the stress of this competition Bertincourt had become,
when the 109th Brigade reluctantly quitted it, a
model village.</p>

<p>So, in line and behind it, the troops were as comfortable
as conditions on any part of the British front allowed. They
would have been as happy as was possible under any conditions
of active service had it not been for the desolation
about them, which bred a feeling of loneliness. The British
soldier had grown used to being billeted in villages, or
lodged in encampments within reach of them. He missed
vaguely the sights of village life, the gallant old men and
the women setting about their endless toil, the clatter of
the farm, the children who watched him falling in for parade,
and came in the afternoon to listen to the band. More
definite was the loss of the shops, the eggs to be bought
from the villagers, the warmth and comfort of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminet</i>,
where he drank his beer, solaced himself with bacon or
fried potatoes if he had gone short of a meal, joked with
the daughter of the host, or played "House" with his friends
on benches about the fire. Officers of the Provost Staff
have stated that in their experience there was almost always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
less crime and unrest among troops in inhabited regions
than among those living upon the Teuton-made <em>veldt</em>.
There was among the men of the Ulster Division little
crime at any time, but undoubtedly they also were in some
degree a prey to the inevitable nostalgia born of desolation.
They would have come far more completely beneath its
influence but for the efforts that were made to afford them
distraction and increase their comfort. "Peace hath her
victories," and a comparatively peaceful life afforded as much
opportunity as battle for the Quarter-master General's
Staff&mdash;"Q"&mdash;to prove its ingenuity and resource. In this
sector the work of the 36th Division "Q" was certainly
triumphant in this respect; first of all under the direction
of Colonel Comyn, for eighteen months A.A. and Q.M.G.,
and then, on his transfer to the War Office, under his successor,
Colonel S. H. Green, who had worked under him
as D.A.Q.M.G. It organized in the first place daily trips
to Amiens. Three lorries, one to take twelve officers, the
remaining two each twenty other ranks, left Ytres at an
early hour each morning for Achiet-le-Grand. Thence the
party went by train to Amiens, being met again by the
lorries at Achiet in the evening. The trips allowed of six
hours or more being spent in the city. Beer was provided in
great quantities to replace the supplies of the lost <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">estaminets</i>.
In September the Division was buying from brewers of
Amiens no less than two railway truck-loads of forty-five
barrels a day. A soda-water factory was established on the
Canal bank at Manancourt. Soda-water, labelled "Boyne
Water," a fancy which appealed to the troops, was sold
at a penny a bottle, and various other aerated concoctions
at twopence. The Divisional Canteens, always of the
greatest benefit to the troops, became then of incalculable
importance. Added to their usual "lines"&mdash;tobacco, biscuits,
chocolate, tinned foods, books, candles&mdash;were now
sold in great quantities fruit and vegetables, eggs, bread and
cake, and, when procurable, fresh fish and even oysters;
while special orders for anything required in Amiens by
officers or men were taken, the goods being procured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the following evening, and sold to the buyer at cost price.
The Division had long had a cinema, a concert party&mdash;"The
Merry Mauves"&mdash;and an excellent band. These passed up
and down the front, all units taking turns in the pleasures
of their performances. Football and boxing competitions
reappeared. There was one very exciting race meeting and
horse show, with numerous classes for transport turn-outs.
For animals at least the area was a paradise, there being
unlimited grazing and great fields of clover. Some agriculture
was attempted, over a hundred acres being ploughed
and sown. A few headquarters purchased cows, and many
units pigs and chickens.</p>

<p>To those who cared to ponder such things, the wonders
of the great, creaking, rather clumsy machine, in which
it took a thousand men to form the tiniest cog, never ceased
to appeal. The British organization for war was assuredly
by now amazingly thorough. Was there required some new-fangled
and complicated Lewis-gun-mounting for trench
warfare; a message and a tracing to some workshop behind
brought a hundred in a week. Copies innumerable of an
enlarged aeroplane photograph wanted in a hurry for a raid
could be printed off at Albert in twenty-four hours. The
little press of the IV. Corps, the Intelligence Branch of
which officers of the 36th Division will remember with
gratitude, seemed to pour forth up-to-date maps. If there
was the slightest hitch about rations, it was the topic of
conversation for a week. The post-office was an unceasing
marvel. In Flanders, Divisional Headquarters had had
their newspapers the day they were published, and the rest
of the troops next morning. The letters for men in the
saps reached them in two or at most three days. A letter
to Hermies would probably take longer now.</p>

<p>But, there was no doubt about the matter, the organization
was expensive in man-power, and man-power at
that moment was a problem that engaged G.H.Q. almost
as much as did the enemy. The writer of this book can
well remember being sent, in Flanders, when the Division
was very weak, to investigate the number of men a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
battalion had in the trenches. The "paper strength" of
that battalion was just six hundred men. It had in the
line, exclusive of its headquarters, one hundred and seven
men. He went through the state with the adjutant. That
revealed, indeed, a remarkably strong battalion headquarters,
and an undue number at the transport lines, but
no other leakages which the adjutant had power to stop.
There was a number of men at Divisional Headquarters,
clerks, draughtsmen, orderlies, a cook, five attached to the
Signal Company; and about three times as many at Brigade
Headquarters. The rest followed varied avocations. Five
were on traffic control, a number attached to a Tunnelling
Company. There were clerks to town majors, camp
wardens, guardians of coal, straw, and ration dumps;
cooks and servants at the Rest Camp. There were about
forty on leave, and twenty sick not evacuated.</p>

<p>There were also twenty at various schools. Schools
were a vital necessity; but who at this period can doubt
that they were ludicrously overdone? Every formation had
its schools&mdash;G.H.Q., the Army, the Corps, the Division,
the Brigade. There were infantry schools, artillery schools,
and trench-mortar schools; machine-gun schools, Lewis-gun
schools, bombing schools, gas schools; schools which
taught horse-mastership, shoe-making, brick-laying, carpentry,
sanitation, butchery, cooking. For a weak Division,
schools became a nightmare. Divisional commanders
had to protest that they had either to man their trenches
inadequately, or refuse vacancies allotted. And vacancies
refused raised a vast to-do, because they threatened the
existence of the school, and the school naturally appealed
to the formation of which it was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>. Up to the
Division headquarters this did not so largely matter. The
Division may have been inconsiderate at times, but it did
know precisely how its line was held, how strong its posts,
how far separated. But above the Division the situation
was not always so quickly grasped. The Corps was an
impersonal affair, encamped, sometimes for years, upon the
same front, changing its Divisions week by week. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
when a Corps headquarters, as happened before Cambrai,
resting out of the line, sent out appeals for students to attend
<em>its</em> schools, so that they might not be idle, the most long-suffering
were inclined to protest and to feel that, after all,
for the idle, there was a certain work which might have
been accomplished somewhat further forward. The jests
of most humorists are based upon exaggeration, but there
is just a kernel of truth in them, or they are not good jests.
Of such nature is the dictum of M. André Maurois,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the
French interpreter who loves the British so well and pokes
such clever fun at them&mdash;that a school "is a plot of ground
traversed by imitation trenches, where officers who have
never been near the line teach war-worn veterans their
business."</p>

<p>The swarm of writers which, under the influence of the
reaction from war, has so bitterly criticised the higher staff
officers for the waste of man-power, has been hopelessly
astray in its estimation of the reason. It was not inefficiency
or carelessness. It was rather the Englishman's
passion for organization, for orderliness and smoothness.
That passion for perfecting the machine put too many cogs
and fly-wheels upon it, made it over-complicated, clumsy.
Ever eager to expand their business, these directors put
into it too much of the one form of capital which they could
not afford&mdash;man-power.</p>

<p>In October began preparations for a great new offensive,
a surprise offensive, which was to depend entirely upon the
use of tanks. The scheme and the plans for the Battle of
Cambrai must be left for discussion till the next chapter.
Here will be detailed only some of the preliminary moves.
The part of the 36th Division in the first day's attack was to
be confined to the capture of the German trenches bounded
by the Bapaume-Cambrai Road and the Canal du Nord. This
was the task of one Brigade only, and the other two were to be
withdrawn from the Trescault and Havrincourt sectors, each
being replaced by a Division. These Divisions, the 51st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
(Highland) and the 62nd (West Riding), were to be kept
in rear as long as possible. It fell, therefore, to the 36th
to do much of the work of preparation in their areas; the
repairing of forward roads, the excavating of new dug-outs,
the construction of bridges over trenches. The C.R.E.'s of
these Divisions, with their Pioneer battalions and some
Engineers, moved forward early in November to work under
the general control of the C.R.E., 36th Division. Havrincourt
Wood was crammed with little wooden hutments,
which its trees and scrub rendered invisible to the enemy.
One of the most important tasks was the metalling of the
roads, and the dumping of metal beside them in parts where
it was impossible to lay it, in order that work might commence
with the assault. The surface of the roads was good,
but only because the Division had been holding a front so
wide, which made the traffic upon them relatively light. It
was quite obvious that a single day of traffic such as an
offensive entails would cut them to pieces. It was front-line
roadmaking upon which the C.R.E., Colonel Campbell,
was required to exercise his ingenuity. Work upon tracks
in Havrincourt Wood was easy; silence was all that was
necessary. But work upon what was to be the most important
communication of the IV. Corps in the offensive,
the road from Metz to Ribécourt, was of great difficulty.
In Trescault, half-way between these villages and almost in
our front line, there were, to begin with, two enormous
craters blown by the enemy before his retirement. These
had to be filled in by night, and it took chalk by the ton
to do it. Road-metal also was stacked by night almost up
to the front line, and covered with camouflage before dawn.
Wooden bridges were prepared for all the trenches crossing
the roads which would be required, and most of these for
British trenches set in position. The problem of gun positions
on the northern part of the front was difficult. Cover
there was none reasonably far forward, save among the
ruins of Hermies and Demicourt. Among these the positions
were prepared, and by night seven hundred rounds per
18-pounder borne up to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>During the first sixteen days of November, the 36th
Division had also to provide parties of from two to six hundred
men daily for unloading trains at Ytres station, for
the Heavy Artillery ammunition dump at Bus, and for the
Field Artillery dump in Vallulart Wood. Trains frequently
did not arrive within six hours of the advertised time, and
the men had to sit about and wait for them, frequently half
through the night&mdash;as ill a preparation for troops on the
eve of an offensive as could well be imagined. Amid much
confusion and unnecessary hardship, one officer earned the
gratitude of the infantrymen by his foresight and consideration,
the Staff Captain of the IV. Corps Heavy Artillery.
He required parties up to seventy-five men, and always at
short notice. He kept three of his lorries always standing
by at his headquarters, telephoned when he wanted men,
and fetched them from Ytres, Neuville, Ruyalcourt, or
Bertincourt, as detailed by the General Staff of the Division.
Better still, he generally gave them tea before sending
them home, to supplement their haversack rations.</p>

<p>The weather favoured the British arrangements amazingly.
It was fine, but morning after morning dawned with
a thick ground mist which hung about all day. Foden
lorries carrying stone and light steam rollers to lay it were
enabled, beneath this shelter, to work at a proximity to the
Germans that had otherwise been out of the question.
Night after night the tanks, upon which all hinged, moved
up into Havrincourt Wood. Here again the mist was a
godsend, for the track of a tank across country is plain
enough on an aeroplane photograph, and not hard to distinguish
with a glass. Contrary to the general belief of
those who have not heard them on the move, the tank is
not very noisy. It was the artillery tractors, dragging up
the big howitzers, which frightened everyone by their clatter.</p>

<p>The relief of the 107th and 108th Brigades took place on
the nights of the 17th and 18th of November. To deceive
the enemy as to the great concentration in front of him,
a screen of the troops of these Brigades remained to hold
the outpost line. These men knew only that a raid on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
large scale was intended. In the early hours of the 18th,
the Germans, evidently somewhat suspicious, raided a sap
held by the 1st Irish Fusiliers behind a heavy "box" barrage,
and took six prisoners. From the evidence of German
prisoners taken subsequently, it appeared that the most the
enemy gathered from the examination of his captives was
that an attempt to capture Havrincourt might be expected.
This aroused in the German command no great uneasiness.
On the 16th, the 14th Rifles had taken over the whole front
of the 109th Brigade to permit the other battalions to train
for their task, This training was carried out by General
Ricardo over trenches laid out to scale with the plough,
upon a front of four thousand yards.</p>

<p>Accommodation was so limited that much marching and
counter-marching was necessary to provide billets for the
51st and 62nd Divisions moving up. In its course the
108th Brigade moved back as far as Barastre, upwards of
eight miles from the front line. By the night of the 19th,
however, the eve of the attack, the infantry was concentrated
well forward. The whole of the 109th Brigade was
in assembly positions, the 108th Brigade in Vélu Wood, and
the 107th Brigade in the area Ytres-Lechelle. The 16th
Rifles were in Havrincourt Wood.</p>

<p>These details have been here given in order that the
next chapter may proceed with the scheme of the Battle of
Cambrai, without interruption to explain the moves which
preceded it. It is in itself one of the most interesting actions
in which the 36th Division took part during its combatant
career, and, at the same time, measuring final result by the
standard of early achievement, one of the most disappointing.
The material results that it produced were small, but
it opened a new era in the history of war. No adequate
conception of the victories of 1918, first of the Germans,
then of the Allies, can be reached without a close study of
its lessons.</p>

<span class="smcap">Cambrai and After (I):<br />
November 20th to 22nd, 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The year 1917 had drawn to its close leaving unfulfilled
most of the high hopes that had buoyed men's spirits in
the opening months. Some, at least, of the causes of their
downfall were far away from the Western Front, and beyond
the control of Generals Nivelle, Pétain, and Sir Douglas
Haig. Russia, that strong-armed but weak-headed and
weak-legged giant, had collapsed, leaving Roumania to its
fate&mdash;complete overthrow. At Carporetto the Italians had
been heavily defeated by the Austro-German armies, and
France and England had been forced to send divisions to
Italy to act as rallying points of resistance. In France the
Champagne offensive had left a legacy of doubt and exasperation
among soldiers as well as civilians, and it had
taken all the fostering skill and care of General Pétain to
restore his troops to the standard at which they had begun
the year. The Flanders offensive, vitally necessary, crippling
to Ludendorff, as he has admitted in his book, had
been unduly prolonged in conditions far more dreadful
even than when the 36th Division had taken part in it.
Not men only but horses were drowned in the shell-holes
ere it was over, and by the time Poelcappelle and Passchendaele
had been reached the evacuation of wounded had
become all but impossible. The heights were won, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
on the southern flank, though at Westroosebeke the enemy
still had the best ground, but, broadly speaking, the
strategical value of the advance was <em>nil</em>.</p>

<p>Passchendaele, indeed, had resolved itself into a terrible
object-lesson. Here was the point to which a mechanical
conception of warfare had led us. Was there not, the
keenest minds in every army were asking, was there not
some outlet? Were men to be forever at the mercy of the
munition factory and the mud of its making, the roll of
barbed wire, the slab of reinforced concrete? Was the real
genius of the soldier never to have the chance to display
itself outside this war of fortifications? Often one heard
the question, academic enough, but of extraordinary interest:
"Could supreme genius, could the greatest captain
that ever lived, could Napoleon have freed his hands from
the deadlock?" The greatest soldier of this war has revealed,
in the incomparable language that is his gift, that
he also had asked himself that question, and answered it
unhesitatingly in the affirmative.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> As affairs were now
marching, it did indeed appear as though we were reverting
to the mere tactics of the battering-ram, as though, metaphorically
speaking,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse12">"Elephants</p>
<p class="verse">And barbèd horses might as well prevail</p>
<p class="verse">As the most subtle stratagems of war."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And a way out from mechanism was found, as might
have been expected, in mechanism.</p>

<p>Whose the credit for the conception of the surprise tank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
assault, whether General Tudor's or General Ellis's, or
another's, it is not here pertinent to speculate. The germ
of the idea was inherent in the tank itself, and must have
been present, vaguely or clearly, in the minds of all who
contributed to its design and organization. Here, at any
rate, had been found an ideal testing-ground for the scheme,
good ground, obstacles which it would have, at that date,
been madness to attack in the conventional manner, the
prospect of inflicting upon the enemy a swift and signal
defeat. Moreover, a blow that would prevent the massing
of more German divisions on the Italian front, where
every German division put new life and dash into at least
two Austrian, was urgently needed. The striking of the
blow was entrusted to General Byng's Third Army.</p>

<p>The plan was simple. The tanks were to roll out gaps
in the wire of the Hindenburg System, through which the
infantry columns could push. The aim was to overcome
the enemy holding the line between the Canal du Nord
and the Canal de l'Escaut, which runs parallel with it at
a distance of from six to eight miles further east; to secure
possession of the area bounded by these Canals on east and
west, and by the marshes of the Sensée River to the north;
and, as a consequence, to clear the whole area west of the
Canal du Nord of hostile forces. It must be remembered
that the German line, running north from Havrincourt to
Mœuvres, there turned west by north. Had the British,
pressing northward, reached Oisy-le-Verger and the banks
of the Sensée River, they would have been ten miles behind
the German front line at that latitude. A precipitate retreat
would have been certain, and a very large haul, if not
of prisoners, at least of material, almost equally so. Even
if the advance to the north accomplished no more than the
consolidation of the high ground round Bourlon Wood,
the Germans would have to abandon the Drocourt-Quéant
Switch, a very strong position. The battle was to have
three stages: the first, a surprise infantry attack assisted
by tanks and an unregistered artillery barrage to capture
the crossings of the Canal de l'Escaut at Masnières and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Marcoing, and a German trench east of them known as
the Masnières-Beaurevoir Line; the second, the advance
of the Cavalry Corps to isolate the city of Cambrai, and
seize the crossings of the Sensée River, while the troops
of the IV. Corps captured Bourlon Wood; and the third,
the clearance of the area and of Cambrai itself. The attack
was to be carried out by the III. Corps on the right and
the IV. Corps on the left, with the V. Corps in reserve.
The right flank of the attack lay upon the great spur,
crowned by the Bois Lateau and the hamlet of Le Pave,
running from Gonnelieu to the Canal de l'Escaut at Crèvecœur;
the left roughly upon the Canal du Nord. There
was to be a subsidiary attack to the north upon the Hindenburg
Line at Bullecourt. If one were to search for a
key-word to define the general idea of the offensive, that key-word
would probably be "exploitation." It was not
intended merely to break through the enemy's defences,
to strike him a heavy blow; it was designed to exploit
a preliminary success, to clear a great tract of country of
hostile troops, to turn a flank; for, be it remembered, the
advance to the Sensée marshes would have involved not
merely a headlong retreat or wholesale capture for the
German troops south of them, but an eventual retirement
of several miles at least to the north. The Drocourt-Quéant
Switch, the main Hindenburg Lines, would be gone.
Cambrai was, for the Western Front, a small battle, but
great events hung upon it.</p>

<p>In the previous accounts of battles it has not been necessary,
for the purpose of writing the History of the 36th
Division, to do more than glance at the progress of the
Divisions fighting upon its flanks. In this battle, on the
contrary, if any adequate conception is to be reached from
the account, the plan and the action of the IV. Corps, that
is, of the two Divisions on the right of the 36th, and the
56th Division, which was under the orders of the IV. Corps
for the greater part of the action, must be studied in some
detail. The right boundary of the IV. Corps was the
Trescault-Ribécourt Road; thence north of Noyelles. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
was to attack with three Divisions, the 51st on the right,
the 62nd in the centre, and the 36th on the left. The 51st
and 62nd Divisions, the left of the latter on the Canal du
Nord, were to advance north from the skirts of Havrincourt
Wood. The normal northern objective of the first day was
the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. If, however, there was little
opposition, the 51st and 62nd Divisions were to press on
and take the high ground crowned by Bourlon Wood and
village, or take them over from the Cavalry if the latter
had occupied them, while the 107th and 108th Brigades of
the 36th Division moved parallel with them east of the
Canal, formed a flank-guard facing west, and seized the
passages of the Canal at Mœuvres and Inchy-en-Artois.
In the event of serious opposition this later programme was
to be that of the next day. The primary task of the 36th
Division was to capture the German trenches west of the
Canal du Nord and south of the Bapaume-Cambrai Road.
For this it was to employ one Brigade, the 109th, one of its
Field Artillery Brigades, the 173rd, together with the 280th
Brigade and the 93rd Army Brigade R.F.A. Its other
Artillery Brigade, the 153rd, was at the disposal of the 62nd
Division, to take part in its preliminary barrage. The plans
were entrusted to General Ricardo, who worked them out
with his Artillery Group Commander, Lieut.-Colonel H. C.
Simpson, D.S.O., and had thus an almost unique opportunity
for a Brigadier on the Western Front of fighting his
own battle in his own fashion. Communication across the
Canal was to be established by the erection of a bridge
on the Demicourt-Flesquières Road, to take wagons and
field guns, at the earliest possible moment. Materials for
this were, of course, prepared in advance, as were some
for a minor bridge, for infantry and pack transport, to be
thrown across at a suitable point some fifteen hundred
yards further south.</p>

<p>A glance at the map<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> will show that the German
defences west of the Canal began at the northern spoil heap,
consisted for the greater part of their length up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Bapaume-Cambrai Road of two main lines, and at their
greatest depth, on a frontage of fifteen hundred yards, of
three. No tanks were allotted to the 36th Division, so a
frontal attack without artillery preparation was out of the
question. It was decided, therefore, to capture the northern
spoil heap, wire in front of which had been cut over
a long period by artillery and a 6-inch trench mortar with
instantaneous fuse&mdash;the latter the best wire-cutter the 36th
Division ever discovered&mdash;and work up the trenches from
south to north. It appeared that this sixty-foot pile would
enable machine and Lewis guns to cover the infantry in
their advance. On paper the task of working up these
trenches, traversed at frequent intervals by rays of wire,
appeared of well-nigh insuperable difficulty. And, indeed,
no planning and no gallantry in execution could have accomplished
it had not the enemy troops been much demoralized
by the advance of the tanks behind them east
of the Canal, as it was intended they should be. The
attack of the 36th Division was, therefore, not to take place
till the main attack had drawn level with its point of departure.
Zero for the former was at 6-20 a.m.; for the
36th Division at 8-35 a.m.</p>

<p>The attack carried out by the 109th Brigade has been
officially described as a "bombing action," and such, doubtless,
to a great extent it was. But there was no fear more
constantly present with General Nugent and General Ricardo
than that of its developing into the conventional bombing
action, which progressed at snail's pace at best, at worst
reached an early deadlock, and always required bombs by
the dozen for every yard of ground gained. In this case
four thousand yards, covered by two or three parallel lines
of trenches, with numerous communication trenches at right
angles to the attack, had to be taken. And speed was essential;
for, much as the attack depended upon the advance
east of the Canal, that in its turn could have been taken in
flank by machine-gunners on the west had not the 109th
Brigade kept pace with it. And so the order was&mdash;no
bombing till other methods failed. At the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
platoon columns to move up the trenches was to be not
a bomber, but a Lewis gunner. A Lewis gun could be
used by a man of large physique&mdash;and of these the Ulster
Division still possessed plenty, if not such numbers as a
year back&mdash;with a sling over the left shoulder, the gun
resting above the right hip. It was heavy and clumsy,
but its tremendous moral effect in such broad trenches as
those of the Hindenburg System can readily be imagined.
It was to be the spear-head of the attack along each line
of trenches. General Ricardo had learnt the idea from the
Canadians, who had employed it at Vimy. Moreover, when
it was found possible, riflemen were to move on top, outside
the trench. The question of artillery support was not easy,
since no preliminary registration, here, or on any other
part of the front of attack, was possible. Colonel
Simpson, who took up his position with General Ricardo
at a command post in the sunken Demicourt-Havrincourt
Road, just short of the British front line, planned
and controlled the artillery support in most brilliant
fashion, well worthy the fame he was winning as one of the
most scientific and least conventional junior artillery commanders
in the British Army. It must not be supposed
that the part played here, or on the whole front, by artillery
was negligible, nor that the barrage was inconsiderable.
On the contrary, the artillery support for the main attack
was of vast weight. In Havrincourt Wood, along the rides,
guns stood almost wheel to wheel. But these guns had not
registered. Consequently the barrage might be expected to
be somewhat ragged, and was to keep considerably further
in front of the tanks and infantry than would otherwise
have been the case. Still, a barrage does not cut wire. It
was the tanks which were to accomplish this. Had they
failed, the whole scheme would have collapsed. During the
night of November the 19th, the whole line of tanks on the
front of the III. and IV. Corps moved to a general distance
of a thousand yards from the German outpost line. The
noise of their advance was covered by long bursts of machine-gun
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>At 6-20 a.m. the great assault was launched. The tanks
went forward behind the barrage, followed by their infantry
columns. From the first moment it was evident that
the calculations of the British staffs had been correct. The
surprise was complete, showing that the Germans had learnt
nothing of importance from their prisoners. The advance
had the precision of clock-work, the infantry following the
tanks without difficulty through gaps in the most formidable
wire entanglements in the world. It was 7-15 ere observers
of the 36th Division upon the ridge east of Hermies could
penetrate the mist and smother of smoke. Then they saw
the tanks going forward over the ridge north of Havrincourt,
well up to the barrage and waiting for each lift, the
columns of the 62nd Division behind them, meeting with
small opposition and suffering few casualties. It was a very
impressive sight. To the Germans it must have been appalling,
this line of great engines rushing through their
magnificent defences as they had been of paper, checking
an instant to put down huge brushwood-bound bundles to
enable them to cross the wide trenches, then moving steadily
and remorselessly on. Here and there a stout-hearted
officer organized momentary resistance, but for the most
part the affair was on one side a rout, on the other a procession.
German barrage there was none; only some
desultory and ineffective shelling. By eight o'clock the first
objective, which included the villages of Havrincourt and
Ribécourt, and Couillet Wood, and, of course, the front
system of the Hindenburg defences, was in our hands all
along the line. In Havrincourt and its château park fighting
continued till ten o'clock or later, but it was without importance.</p>

<p>Upon the first objective there was a pause to allow troops
for the next to pass through. At 8-35 a.m. the new advance
began. Here again all went well&mdash;save at one point. The
62nd Division swept on unchecking; on the front of the
III. Corps all resistance was easily overcome. But the 51st
Division had no such fortune. The Highlanders were
baffled by the village of Flesquières, perched upon its hill-top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Field-guns, dragged from their pits on the north side
of the village, came into action as the tanks approached,
firing over open sights, at point-blank range, crumpling
them up, one after the other. The front line of the Hindenburg
Support System was pierced; but as the tanks could
not cut the wire of the second line, the infantry could not
penetrate it. For the moment there was deadlock here.
We must turn to our more immediate problem, the attack
of the 109th Brigade, launched simultaneously with the
general advance from the first objective.</p>

<p>For the assault upon the spoil heap a battery of four-inch
Stokes mortars to fire "thermit" shell, which had been
used with effect at Messines, had been procured. For four
minutes these mortars and the covering artillery bombarded
its south-west side. Then the 10th Inniskillings charged
home and took it. There was no serious fighting here.
The effect of the "thermit" shell was terrific morally. The
defenders ran northwards up the trenches. A number were,
however, killed by machine-gun fire, while seventy prisoners
and two machine-guns were taken. The prisoners belonged
to the 20th Landwehr Division, which had not been identified,
and had come into line but two days before. This
discovery was of good augury for the attack, since by this
period of the war Landwehr troops were not of high quality.</p>

<p>The necessary point of entry into the German trenches
having been won, the 10th Inniskillings pushed up them
according to plan, behind their barrage. A second doorway
was forced when, directly the barrage lifted from it, a company
of the 14th Rifles, attached to the 10th Inniskillings,
entered the communication trench on the Demicourt-Flesquières
Road, fifteen hundred yards north of the first one.
The clearing of the captured trenches was carried out most
systematically. The leading platoons dropped a man at the
entrance to each deep dug-out, to be picked up by the fourth
section following in rear, which was allotted the duty of
"mopping up." As each dug-out was cleared, a notice-board
was set up at entrance bearing the significant inscription
"Mopped"! When the leading platoon exhausted its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
men, another moved through to the front, the first reorganizing
behind it. A single flag with the battalion colours
was carried by the leading platoon, and never displayed save
at the head of the advance. The 10th Inniskillings reached
their objective just north of the Demicourt-Flesquières
Road at 9-30 a.m., or a few minutes behind schedule
time. This, however, was of no significance, since the line
now held was part of the general second objective of the
whole attack, and there was a pause upon it of twenty-five
minutes. The second objective had been reached upon the
whole front, save only at Flesquières.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 9th Inniskillings, responsible for the next
phase of the attack after the 10th had captured Hill 90,
had moved in. Those only who have seen the Hindenburg
trenches can realize how comparatively easy it was to
pass one body of troops through another in them. In
ordinary trenches such methods would have resulted in
hopeless congestion. Here all went smoothly owing to the
great breadth of the trenches. The 9th Inniskillings had
one platoon moving along the bed of the Canal, here dry.
Craters on the Demicourt-Graincourt Road, defended by
machine-guns, caused trouble, but the right companies
pushed on, and gradually the situation cleared. The 11th
Inniskillings, for the final stage of the attack, had now
moved in. This battalion met with somewhat stronger resistance.
On the right some determined German bombers
held up the advance for a while, the Lewis gunner not
being able to see them. Here, as was generally the case,
the Germans with their stick bombs outranged our men
with the Mills, but the Mills rifle grenade more than restored
the balance, and the Germans were driven steadily
back. This company of the 11th Inniskillings was also
able to give material assistance to the men of the 186th
Brigade, across the Canal, by its Lewis-gun fire. Lock 6
was the last centre of strong resistance. Eventually the
garrison fled across the Canal, though few of them reached
the other side. About half-past three the Inniskillings
crossed the Cambrai-Bapaume Road, and were soon afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
consolidating their position, with their outpost three
or four hundred yards north of it. The bridge across the
Canal here, it may be added, had been blown up hours
earlier. It had never been doubted by the British that the
enemy had prepared it for demolition.</p>

<p>On the left of the 109th Brigade the 56th Division now
prolonged the line along the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. On
its right the 62nd Division, working up the Hindenburg
Support System and over open country, had met with complete
success. Graincourt had been reached and taken at
1-30, and the long communication trench north of the
Bapaume-Cambrai Road was consolidated at the same time
as the final objective of the 36th. On the III. Corps front
Noyelles had been reached. But the failure of the 51st
Division to capture Flesquières constituted a serious menace
to the whole scheme of the attack. It would have been
greater had the village been strongly held by the Germans,
for then the troops of the 62nd Division could never have
advanced past it as they did. The fact seems to be that
it was the supreme gallantry of one German officer, aided
by the merest handful of men, that withstood the attack.
The attack was renewed with fresh tanks during the afternoon
without success, that one heroic officer, it is said,
firing his last gun with deadly effect with his own hands
upon the tanks, the wreckage of which, horribly twisted
and maimed, strewed the steep slope at nightfall. A patrol
of King Edward's Horse, attached to the 62nd Division,
had early in the afternoon ridden into the village from the
north-west, and reported it clear as far as the Marcoing
Road. An attack from this direction by quite a small force
would probably have overcome what opposition there was.</p>

<p>The fact that Flesquières remained untaken caused some
alteration in the employment of the cavalry. The 1st
Cavalry Division was to have been passed through Marcoing,
but at 4-30 p.m. the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was ordered
instead to occupy Cantaing, which should have been already
captured had all proceeded according to plan. But the
village was strongly held and the cavalrymen were beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
off. The Brigade therefore remained that night in Noyelles.
Just before dusk a company of the 186th Brigade<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
and two squadrons of King Edward's Horse made an attack
upon Anneux, but were unsuccessful, owing to wire about
the village and machine-gun fire from within it.</p>

<p>At 1-30 the 107th and 108th Brigades moved forward,
the former to the northern slope of the Grand Ravin about
Square Copse, the latter to Yorkshire Bank and the old
British trenches south of it. It had now begun to rain
heavily, and these troops, particularly those of the 107th
Brigade, which were without any shelter, were drenched to
the skin. At 8 o'clock the 107th Brigade was ordered across
into Havrincourt and the trenches and dug-outs about it.
The men were not finally settled with an opportunity for
rest till 3 a.m. the following morning. The 10th Inniskillings
of the 109th Brigade, which had carried out the
first stages of its attack, was moved across the Canal to
Kangaroo Alley, south of and parallel with the Bapaume-Cambrai
Road. Patrols pushed forward on the west side
by the 11th Inniskillings got within five hundred yards of
the southern outskirts of Mœuvres, where they encountered
resistance enough to compel them to withdraw. There is
no reason, however, to suppose that Mœuvres was at this
time strongly held, or that a determined attack would have
failed to take it. The progress east of the Canal did not
appear to warrant such an attack. The Engineers meanwhile
had progressed excellently with their bridge-making.
By 4 p.m. their bridge for infantry and pack transport,
about a thousand yards north of the Hermies-Havrincourt
railway line, was available. Half an hour later a still more
important task had been accomplished; the existing causeway
on the Demicourt-Flesquières Road having been repaired
to enable field-guns and wagons to cross. The 36th
Division would have been glad to have had at this stage its
Pioneer Battalion to work upon its own roads, now being
churned up by heavy traffic, but it was employed upon a
similar task between Havrincourt and Ribécourt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
The Signal Service, admirably organized by Major
Vigers, who on this occasion excelled, if that were possible,
his successes at Messines, had opened up telephone communication,
utilising the Canal bed to lay its wires. So
good was this that it was a matter of no difficulty to speak
from Divisional Headquarters, which still remained at
Ytres, to Lock 6, just south of the Bapaume-Cambrai
Road.</p>

<p>When dusk came down to bring operations to a halt,
the situation was as follows. The 36th Division held a
general line five hundred yards north of the Bapaume-Cambrai
Road, in touch with the 56th on its left. East
of the Canal the 62nd Division held the trench north of the
road and the factory. Thence their line curved down just
west of Anneux, with a long flank running east of Graincourt
to the west of Flesquières. The line of the III. Corps
ran well to the north of Noyelles. This left, as will be
seen from the line roughly marked on the map, an extraordinary
little German salient, in the midst of which there
were still apparently German guns in action in Orival Wood.</p>

<p>During the night there was great movement of guns.
Most of the heavy artillery of the IV. Corps, since it was
difficult to move it through Havrincourt, and would have
been harder to feed it, took up positions about Hermies
and Demicourt, with the heaviest pieces back at Doignies.
Here it could easily be served with ammunition, and here
it proved invaluable in the days that were to come. The
153rd Brigade had a very long march. After covering the
advance of the 62nd Division from Havrincourt Wood,
the guns were withdrawn at midnight and moved, <em>via</em>
Ruyalcourt, Hermies, and Demicourt, to positions in the
old "No Man's Land," east of the last-named village. The
batteries of the 173rd Brigade also moved to this neighbourhood,
to be prepared to cover a further advance. The
bad, narrow roads were, as may readily be imagined, in
a state of much congestion. Batteries of the 153rd Brigade
were not in action till 7-30 a.m. on the 21st.</p>

<p>In the course of the day's fighting the IV. Corps had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
taken over two thousand prisoners, of which the share of
the 109th Brigade was five hundred and nine. The latter
had also taken a great deal of booty, particularly at Lock 6,
which had been used as a general store-house for the forward
area.</p>

<p>So ended the first day's fighting. The cavalry action
on a grand scale had been a complete failure. Whatever
chances of success it may have had were extinguished by
the failure to take Flesquières. For the rest, all had gone
according to plan. The Bourlon Ridge had not, it is true,
been taken. That, however, was really, except in the case
of unexpectedly sweeping good fortune, to be the second
day's objective. Hopes still stood high.</p>

<p>At dawn on the 21st the German salient was eaten up
in a flash. The 51st Division, advancing through Flesquières,
swept up to the Graincourt-Marcoing Road, upon
which it was established by 11 a.m. A number of guns
in Orival Wood were captured. Cantaing, too, fell, after
stiff fighting, before the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, assisted by
battalions of the 51st Division. Late in the afternoon the
Highlanders, who made tremendous efforts to atone for
the failure of the previous day, stormed Fontaine-Notre-Dame,
on the road from Bapaume to Cambrai, a mere two and
a half miles from the latter city. The right flank of the 62nd
Division also did well. Anneux was taken, and, after heavy
fighting, Anneux Chapel, on the skirts of Bourlon Wood.
But the attack on Bourlon Wood was a failure. The troops
went round the western slopes in gallant fashion, but were
woefully thinned out by machine-gun fire and unable to
hold their ground. They advanced, however, to the south-west
corner.</p>

<p>West of the Canal the attack was pushed forward by
the 109th Brigade, with the 9th Inniskillings, who reached
the point where the Hindenburg trenches swung west, a
thousand yards north of the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. Here
the battalion was held up by heavy machine-gun fire from
Lock 5 and east of the Canal. At noon the 14th Rifles
and 10th Inniskillings resumed the attack. In face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
steadily-increasing opposition they penetrated to the outskirts
of Mœuvres, but could not maintain their position
under withering machine-gun fire from the village and the
Hindenburg trenches west of it. The day's advance was
one of less than a thousand yards, after considerably heavier
casualties than those of the 20th.</p>

<p>The ground won appeared considerable on paper, but
the day had not been successful. The advance had fallen
very far short of the programme. It had been intended
that the 62nd and 51st Divisions should reach Bourlon,
while the 1st Cavalry Division followed through and seized
the Canal crossings from Sains-lez-Marquion northward.
The two reserve brigades of the 36th Division were to have
pressed up on the east side of the Canal, and held its line
from Mœuvres to Sains-lez-Marquion. All this had gone
by the board. The 40th Division from the V. Corps had
moved forward to the area Beaumetz-Doignies-Boursies, to
be ready to take over Bourlon Wood when captured, and
resume the advance. It did not come into action that day
any more than the 107th and 108th Brigades.</p>

<p>The orders for the 22nd were for the 51st and 62nd
Divisions to improve and consolidate their positions, while
the 36th and 56th gained ground on their left. The 109th
Brigade had now shot its bolt, having accomplished its task
with every credit. In the early hours of the morning the
108th moved up to relieve it, and by 7 a.m. the 12th Rifles
had taken over its advanced positions, the 9th Irish Fusiliers
being closed up behind the leading battalion in the trenches
about the Bapaume-Cambrai Road. The relieved Brigade
withdrew to the old British trenches about Hermies.</p>

<p>East of the Canal the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of the 107th Brigade was to
clear the first and second lines of the Hindenburg Support
System up to the Canal, while the 108th took Mœuvres.
This task was allotted to the 15th Rifles. A second battalion,
the 10th Rifles, was then to pass through and continue
the attack along what was known as the Canal du Nord
Line to Lock 4, opposite Inchy. General Withycombe
moved up to a German dug-out west of Graincourt. Eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
guns of the 107th Machine-Gun Company were to assist
in covering these attacks east of the Canal. The general
rate of the barrage was to be fifty yards in five minutes east
of the Canal, and fifty yards in seven and a half minutes
west of it. The attack was further to be supported by four
Siege and one Heavy Battery, and one 9.2-inch howitzer.
It was to be launched at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>It was anticipated by the enemy. At 9-20 he counter-attacked
upon the front of the 51st and 62nd Divisions.
The latter lost no ground on its right, but its extreme left
flank fell back for a short time on to the Bapaume-Cambrai
Road, subsequently reoccupying its position. Worse fortune
met the British further east, where the 51st Division lost
Fontaine. During the counter-attack there occurred one
very remarkable incident. A battery of machine-guns of
the 36th Division was in action in the open, pushed forward
much too far, half-way between Lock 5 and the factory
on the Bapaume-Cambrai Road, when it was attacked at
close quarters by a company of the enemy. The officer
and section sergeant were killed and the guns surrounded.
Two guns of another battery were brought into action by
Major Miller, the Divisional Machine-Gun Officer, at little
over a hundred yards' range. The effect was withering,
the Germans melting away before the fire, saving themselves
by jumping into trenches or crouching in shell-holes. When
quiet had supervened, a machine-gun officer counted forty-two
dead Germans about the recaptured position.</p>

<p>The attack of the 36th Division was launched at 11 a.m.,
after a forty minutes' bombardment. On the right the
leading company of the 15th Rifles reached its objective,
gaining upwards of five hundred yards of the Hindenburg
trenches. The companies which passed through it had a
more difficult task. The trenches of the second line were
here but half dug, and this, seeing that the attack was working
up along them, was to the advantage of the defenders. The
Germans established a block above a length of trench about
a foot deep, and beat off every attempt by machine-gun fire.
At dusk the 10th Rifles made an attempt to rush the machine-guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
but could not get near them, losing six officers in
trying to do so.</p>

<p>West of the Canal things went better at the opening.
The 12th Rifles attacked Mœuvres with three companies
in line. The two on the left penetrated the village, but
the right company was held up by machine-guns in the
Hindenburg Support System. On the left, troops of the
56th Division, bombing up the Hindenburg Front System,
captured Tadpole Copse. Colonel Goodwin, commanding
the 12th Rifles, now handled his battalion with great skill.
He ordered his right company to bomb its way up the trench
leading from the sunken Mœuvres-Graincourt Road to the
Hindenburg Support System, while the other companies
exploited their semi-success in the village. The right company
did succeed in reaching the front trench of the Support
System, and in clearing it, but the second line was full of
Germans and could never be reached. Meanwhile the
centre and western side of the village had been cleared,
many Germans being killed in dug-outs and cellars. Pushing
on through the village, the Riflemen took the trench on
the western edge, fringing the cemetery, and began to consolidate
it. Then came the counter-attack.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. the enemy was seen assembling in great force
in Hobart Street, half-way between Mœuvres and Inchy,
and in the Hindenburg Support System north-west of the
former village. Messages were sent back for support and
for an artillery barrage. Both were procured, the former
in the shape of a company of the 9th Irish Fusiliers, but,
unfortunately, neither of them in time. The counter-attack,
launched just before dusk, appeared to be made by two
battalions, one working parallel with the Hindenburg Support
System and one down the Canal, in several waves.
The company in the trench east of the cemetery was forced
to withdraw to avoid being surrounded. Our men fell back
from position to position, in orderly fashion, taking toll of the
enemy with their Lewis guns. There was no trace of fluster,
still less of panic. It took the Germans, in fact, an hour
and forty minutes from the launching of their attack to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the 12th Rifles to the southern outskirts of the village. It
was a piece of evil fortune after a fine achievement in village
fighting. It must be remembered that there was a heavy
German barrage south of Mœuvres and machine-gun fire
from either flank, which delayed the supports of the 9th
Irish Fusiliers.</p>

<p>The action once again demonstrated the disadvantages
inherent in attacks on narrow fronts. The Hindenburg
trenches west of Mœuvres, on higher ground, overlooked
the village and permitted intense machine-gun fire to be
concentrated upon it. They were outside the area of operations.
In the same way, from the Hindenburg trenches
east of the Canal, heavy machine-gun fire was kept up on
the village and its approaches. This ground also was, for
practical purposes, outside the area of operations, since it
could not be taken without artillery preparation or tanks.
There had been no artillery preparation, and no tanks were
available.</p>

<p>The close of this rather unsatisfactory day may fittingly
mark the end of a chapter. After wonderful initial success
the action had not continued as planned. Little has been
said of the extreme right flank because space does not permit.
Nor does it in any way concern the 36th Division. But
here also, though Masnières, across the Canal de l'Escaut,
had been taken, the great cavalry "drive" had been a failure.
Henceforth the battle was to be fought in other circumstances.
Fresh German troops were up now, and resistance
all along the line was fierce. Every yard of ground had to
be won by hard fighting. The idea of exploitation to the
Sensée River must have faded from the mind of the Commander
of the Third Army. Indeed, he permitted a Division
intended for that purpose, the 40th, to relieve the 62nd,
now very weary. But much had been won. It was of the
highest importance now to take the Bourlon Ridge. While
it remained in German hands all our positions were overlooked,
and could have been made in time almost untenable.
In our hands, on the contrary, it would have been a veritable
thorn in the side of the Germans, and would soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
have compelled an important retirement to the north, if
neither so swift nor so great as that which would have been
involved by our reaching Oisy-le-Verger.</p>

<p>A new phase was opening, of powerful forces on either
side battling fiercely for position. And the crown of battle,
looming up above the combatants, was the great circular
mass of the Bois de Bourlon.</p>

<span class="smcap">Cambrai and After (II):<br />
November 23rd to December 31st, 1917</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The conditions under which the attack was continued were
difficult in the extreme. From the 23rd of November
onward the enemy artillery fire increased enormously, while
the ground appeared to be powdered with machine-guns
skilfully and tenaciously fought. The troops of the 36th
Division were weary. Even such battalions as had not
already been in action were suffering from the long exposure
to bad weather. And the weather was worsening.
Hitherto it had been wet, but, for November, not cold,
though the nights were trying enough for troops in fighting
kit and with small shelter. Now it began to appear as
though the rain would turn to snow. The most formidable
difficulty of all was that of communications. The light
railways, of which so much had been hoped, were useful
certainly, but had not come up to expectation. The roads
were bad beyond expression. The main communication of
the 36th Division was the Hermies-Graincourt Road. Over
the greater part of its length it was sunken, as were those
from Hermies to Demicourt, and from Demicourt to Graincourt.
Being sunken, it was impossible to widen these mere
country lanes, nor was there anything approaching a sufficiency
of metal to sustain the huge volume of traffic upon
them. On the Hermies-Graincourt Road there were frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
serious blocks in the traffic during the early days,
when a limber broke a pole or a cooker lost a wheel. Eventually
the road itself ceased to be used at all, traffic proceeding
on either side of the banks, and chalk being hastily tumbled
into the holes which it speedily made.</p>

<p>The plans of the IV. Corps for November the 23rd were
ambitious enough, yet more modest than those of the preceding
day. On the right the 51st Division was to retake
Fontaine, and secure the high ground east of Bourlon Wood.
The 40th Division, which had relieved the 62nd, was to
take Bourlon village. The 36th and 56th Divisions were
to advance up the Canal and roll up the Hindenburg Support
System. Tanks were to assist the attack of the 36th Division
for the first time during the operations.</p>

<p>The advance of the 36th Division was again to bestride
the Canal du Nord. The 107th Brigade was to attack on the
east side, the 108th Brigade on the west. The former was to
be supported by the 93rd Army Field Artillery Brigade and
a Siege Battery; the latter by the Division's own Artillery
Brigades. The sixteen tanks available were allotted to the
107th Brigade. General Withycombe held a conference of
commanding officers and officers of the Tank Battalion at
his headquarters near Graincourt. The attack was to have
two phases: the first, the capture of the Hindenburg trenches:
up to the Canal, of Round Trench and Lock 5; the second,
an advance northward to Hobart Street from the Canal to
the north corner of Quarry Wood, the northern and eastern
skirts of which were to be held. To the first phase eleven
tanks were allotted; to the second five, with any survivors
of the first. An hour and a half was considered sufficient
for the carrying through of the first phase; after which
there was to be an hour's pause before the opening of the
second.</p>

<p>West of the Canal the capture of Mœuvres was to
coincide with the first phase. The second was to be the
capture of the trench running westward from Lock 4 to
the Hindenburg Support System. Zero for the first phase
was fixed at 10-30 a.m., the earliest moment possible, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that General Withycombe had not been able to issue his
orders till 8-30, owing to the difficulty in collecting the
tank officers. One company commander in the 107th Brigade
has informed the writer that he had less than fifteen
minutes to assemble his men and explain the attack to his
officers.</p>

<p>The task of the 15th Rifles was the rolling up of the
Hindenburg Support System to the Canal, and on the success
of that battalion the whole scheme of the 107th Brigade
depended. It was nothing less than a calamity that of the
two tanks that should have led the troops, one broke down,
while the other turned off to the right and left them. As
they went forward they met overwhelming machine-gun
fire. One company made an advance of some hundred
yards, while one of its platoons most gallantly rushed an
enemy crater-post in the road running north from the
factory. But the company was inadequately supported,
being neither reinforced nor supplied with ammunition and
rifle grenades, and, far from being able to improve its
position, had eventually to abandon some of the ground
won. The 8th Rifles, assisted by a tank, captured and
consolidated Round Trench, also Lock 5, where a few
prisoners were taken. A frontal attack upon the Hindenburg
System was here out of the question, and these minor
successes represented all the ground gained. It is doubtful
whether more than two tanks out of the eleven ever crossed
the Hindenburg Support System, the rest having either
broken down or been put out of action by the German
artillery fire, now very heavy. Without them, advance was
all but impossible. It was the more unfortunate since the
40th Division had made a very fine attack and captured
Bourlon, while the 51st again took Fontaine. Repeated and
heavy counter-attacks drove the 40th from Bourlon, but the
Germans could never penetrate the wood. The 51st were
also driven out of Fontaine, and the line of the 40th was
represented by a very dangerous salient.</p>

<p>In the attack on Mœuvres, the 12th Rifles, with the
9th Irish Fusiliers on the right, made small progress till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the fresher 2nd Rifles was thrown in to support them.
Stubborn village fighting lasted all day. By dusk three-quarters
of the village had been cleared, and four machine-guns
captured by the 2nd Rifles. But while the Hindenburg
trenches either side of the village remained untaken,
consolidation was impossible. At dusk the troops were
withdrawn to the southern houses. Before the next dawn
the 108th Brigade was relieved by the 109th.</p>

<p>That day's fighting represented the last attack made by
the 36th Division. The 107th Brigade was to have made
on the morrow another attempt to advance, and would
doubtless this time have captured at least the Hindenburg
Support System, since it was to have had the co-operation
of practically all the IV. Corps Heavy Artillery. The day
began, however, with a violent German assault on Bourlon
Wood, which drove the troops of the 40th Division back
to a general line about half-way through it. The artillery
was in consequence switched right to put down a barrage
against this attack, and later to support the highly successful
counter-attack of the 40th Division and some dismounted
cavalry squadrons, which more than restored the original
line. The attack of the 107th Brigade, without the necessary
artillery assistance, could have achieved no more than
that of the previous day. Colonel Clements, commanding
the 1st Irish Fusiliers, took the responsibility of ordering
his men not to advance, in which he was entirely justified.
During the counter-attack, a body of sixty Germans which
essayed to advance down the Hindenburg Line was almost
annihilated by the fire of machine-guns and the Lewis guns
of the 15th Rifles. A machine-gun was captured here by
this battalion. West of the Canal, Germans debouching
from Inchy, apparently to launch a counter-attack here also,
were dispersed by artillery fire.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Bourlon village was taken once more.
The IV. Corps had cancelled the attack, owing to the
shortage of tanks. But communication between the 40th
Division and its 121st Brigade having broken down, the
latter attacked and took Bourlon with the twelve tanks at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
its disposal. On the front of the Guards' Division, which
had relieved the 51st the previous night, there was no
fighting of importance.</p>

<p>The 25th was an eventless day for the troops of the
36th Division, but for heavy shelling, particularly of its
batteries. On the right the Germans again attacked Bourlon,
as it was inevitable they should, while they had a battalion
to go forward or artillery to cover its advance. After
hard fighting they retook it, but could not penetrate the
wood, which was in fact now almost impassable, owing to
the haze of the gas with which it had been drenched among
the trees. The 40th Division had suffered heavy casualties,
and was relieved at night by the 62nd. On the following
night the 36th Division was to have taken over a wider
front, extending its line to within a thousand yards of the
western edge of Bourlon Wood. The 107th Brigade had
suffered appreciable casualties and its troops were jaded,
so the 108th Brigade was to relieve it. At the last moment,
however, these orders were cancelled. The Commander of
the IV. Corps decided to relieve the 36th Division by the
2nd, which had been put at his disposal, and ordered that
the relief should take place that night. The Artillery,
Engineers, and Pioneers were to remain at the disposal of
the 2nd Division. The machine-guns were to be relieved
twenty-four hours later.</p>

<p>The night of November the 26th will remain an unpleasant
memory to the survivors of the troops who were
then relieved. The snow had come now, and swept almost
horizontally before a wind that rose at times to tempestuous
force. The relief took a very long time. When it
was over, and the men staggered through the blizzard to
the very indifferent havens that were to be their lodgings
for the night&mdash;Beaumetz for the 108th Brigade, Doignies
for the 109th, Hermies and the trenches about it for the
107th&mdash;they found this shelter, such as it was, packed with
odd units. Doignies, in particular, had scarce a corner,
being full of details of another Division. The besetting
sin of the British Army, the accumulation of what might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
almost be described as camp followers, was on such occasions
as these a curse. A good many men spent what was
left of the night in the open, in the snow.</p>

<p>The following day the Division, less Artillery, Engineers,
and Pioneers, moved to the area Barastre-Rocquigny-Beaulencourt,
where the men had at least some comfort and
the chance to sleep. A day was spent here in the usual
tasks of cleaning, refitting, and reorganization.</p>

<p>The Division, to which the 121st Field Company had
now been returned, was transferred on November the 29th
from the IV. to the XVII. Corps, which was holding the
line east of Arras. It was to move to the area round
Fosseux by tactical trains from Ytres and Bapaume, the
transport moving by road, staging on the night of the 29th
at Gomiecourt, Achiet-le-Petit, and Courcelles-le-Comte,
ruined villages of the Somme area, in which some shelter
for men and animals had been constructed. An agreeable
prospect was held out by Staff Officers of the XVII. Corps
of some weeks at least out of the line. How far it was
realized will shortly appear. For the explanation we must
turn once more to the line at Cambrai.</p>

<p>The IV. Corps made another attempt upon Bourlon, the
morning after the relief of the 36th Division. Aided by
tanks the 62nd Division captured half the village, but could
not hold it against powerful German counter-attacks. It
clung still, however, to the eastern houses and to the wood.
Three battalions of the Guards' Division penetrated Fontaine,
but were unsupported and had to be withdrawn at
dusk. The resources of the Third Army permitted no
further attack. On the evening of the 29th the IV. Corps
relieved the Guards' Division by the 59th and the 62nd
by the 47th. It had thus in line on the 30th three comparatively
fresh Divisions.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th was launched the great
German counter-offensive. It is called counter-offensive
advisedly. It was, in effect, the greatest attack made by
German forces on the Western Front since Verdun had
died down, more than eighteen months before. Counter-attacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on a large scale had been expected, and preparation
made to meet them, but this was something far more serious.
It was a deliberately prepared attempt, supported by a great
weight of artillery, to apply pincers north and south to the
large salient formed by our recent advance. Its effect was
curious, since on the south it was completely successful,
while on the north it gained scarce a yard.</p>

<p>Of the northern blow the weight fell mainly from Bourlon
Wood westward, upon the 47th, the 2nd, and 56th
Divisions. The resistance of these, one an "Old Army"
Division, the others London Territorials, stands high among
the achievements of the British Army in the war. Here
and there a section of trench was lost, a portion of a line
slightly withdrawn, a position temporarily abandoned, but,
broadly speaking, the great assault, launched in eight or ten
successive waves, followed by columns in artillery formation,
preceded by a whirlwind bombardment of all calibres, with
gas and smoke, was a total failure. Repeated attacks
throughout the day met a like fate. And not since the
early days of the war had our artillery and machine-guns
seen such targets. The fact that the IV. Corps Heavy
Artillery had not been moved into the German lines, but
was about Doignies and Demicourt, was now of incalculable
value. It took the advancing host in enfilade. The
field artillery likewise did enormous execution. The Left
Group covering the 2nd Division consisted of the 153rd
and 173rd Brigades, under the command of Colonel Simpson,
who was with the Infantry Brigadier in the old headquarters
in "Scotch Street." The 153rd Brigade alone fired ten thousand
rounds that day. Many large parties of the enemy
were caught in the open by its fire. Enemy batteries were
seen following up the attack, unlimbering and coming into
action. Several sections of 18-pounders and 4.5 howitzers
of the 173rd Brigade were run up on to the crest of the
Demicourt Ridge, whence they annihilated these batteries
with direct fire. Ere nightfall a situation which had had
critical moments was restored.</p>

<p>But, as all the world knows, no such rebuff met the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
southern arm of the pincer. Here the Germans broke
through the British lines; Masnières, defended by a brigade
of the 29th Division, held out, but to the extreme
south of the original advance the front collapsed. La
Vacquerie was retaken by the enemy. Further south he
bit deeply even into our old line, taking Villers-Guislain,
Gonnelieu, and Gouzeaucourt, all of which had been ours
before November the 20th, and the last-named of which
had then been over two thousand yards from our front line.
The prisoners captured by the enemy ran into many thousands,
and the guns into hundreds. It was a woeful affair,
of which the main causes were the lack of an organized
defence in depth, and that of training in junior officers and
men.</p>

<p>It is pleasanter to turn to the very fine counter-attack
by troops of the Guards' Division, fortunately out of the
line and still in the neighbourhood. It was made at mid-day,
and drove the Germans headlong through Gouzeaucourt
and a thousand yards east of it. Further attempts
were made that night and the following day to retake
Gonnelieu and La Vacquerie, but without success. The
enemy maintained his foothold in these villages and upon
the edge of the Welsh Ridge. How far precisely the German
advance progressed it is not easy to determine. It
is certain at least that it was far east of Gouzeaucourt, and
that the main communication of the IV. Corps, the Trescault-Metz
Road, was seriously threatened at a time when
that Corps' own troops were maintaining their positions.
That calamity was averted by the action of the Guards'
Division.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It was at mid-day, while staffs were reconnoitring camps
in the neighbourhood of Arras, that news reached the 36th
Division of the break-through. Accompanying the news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
came orders that it should instantly retrace its steps. There
was no time now to provide trains upon the congested
railways. The troops were to march back through the
devastated area, Brigade Groups staging the night at Achiet-le-Petit,
Courcelles, and Gomiecourt. They were on the
move by half-past two that afternoon, cyclists having been
sent out to meet the transport and turn it back. The following
night saw the Division in the area Lechelle-Bancourt-Rocquigny.
The men were very fatigued after ten days of
what was practically open warfare, followed by marching
and counter-marching. As for the transport horses, they
too were feeling the strain of dragging heavy loads over
atrocious roads, and had in many cases not been unhitched
before their heads were turned south again. Moreover,
the accommodation for men and animals in the Lechelle
area was of the scantiest.</p>

<p>At 4 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd, the III. Corps
informed the 36th Division that the latter had been placed
at its disposal from noon on the following day. Officers
from the 108th Brigade were ordered to reconnoitre the
area then held by the 88th Brigade of the 29th Division,
and from the 109th Brigade part of the area held by troops
of the 61st Division on its right. Later in the day, after
the reconnaissance had been carried out and invaluable
lives lost in its course, these orders were modified. The
Germans made a fresh attack at Gonnelieu. For a time
the situation on the VII. Corps front was highly critical,
but the attack died down after the enemy had made a certain
advance. The 108th Brigade was put at the disposal of
the 61st Division, and ordered to send up a battalion to
hold an old British trench near Beaucamp. Later in the
afternoon the whole of the Brigade was moved up to the
neighbourhood of this village.</p>

<p>On December the 4th the 107th and 109th Brigades
moved up from Lechelle and Bertincourt, halting in Havrincourt
Wood for dinners <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>. The 107th Brigade was
disposed in old British trenches between Beaucamp and
Villers-Plouich, the 109th in the old German front line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
north of the former, where it was in reserve to the 6th Division.
The two Field Companies left behind, and the
Pioneers, rejoined the Division, moving to a camp near
Dessart Wood. Headquarters of the Division were established
in an infantry camp at Sorel-le-Grand. That night
the 108th Brigade relieved the 88th in the line, in the
Couillet Valley. The next night the 109th Brigade followed,
taking over the important plateau known as Welsh Ridge
from the 182nd Brigade of the 61st Division.</p>

<p>On this night G.H.Q. carried out a grave but inevitable
decision. The success of the German attack on the southern
face of the Bourlon-Noyelles-Masnières Salient had made
that salient so narrow in proportion to its depth that its
maintenance would be a constant source of attrition. A
considerable portion of the ground here, including Bourlon
Wood, Cantaing, Noyelles, Graincourt, and Marcoing, was
evacuated, all dug-outs within the area being systematically
destroyed. This withdrawal was to have an effect
upon the relief to be carried out by the 36th Division.</p>

<p>The new line, of which General Nugent assumed command
on the relief of the 182nd Brigade, was curious and
somewhat indeterminate as to exact position. It represented
an acute salient, of which the nose pointed due east.
Behind this ran, from south-west to north-east, the deep,
densely-wooded Couillet Valley. At the south-west end
was the ruined village of Villers-Plouich, at the north-east
the little damaged village of Marcoing, captured by the
British in the Cambrai battle, but now again in German
hands. On either side of the Couillet Valley were the two
ridges destined to become famous, Welsh Ridge on the
south-east, and Highland Ridge on the north-west. Across
these, at right angles to the Couillet Valley, ran the two
Hindenburg Systems, which on Welsh Ridge drew to within
two hundred yards of each other, forming a single system
of defence. That fact proved how highly the men who had
sited those trenches rated the importance of Welsh Ridge.
To the British at this moment it was well-nigh as valuable
as it had been to the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that the evacuation of Marcoing
had taken place on the night of the 4th. There was still
some uncertainty as to the position of the British outpost
line. There was more before the relief was complete. The
9th Inniskillings of the 109th Brigade sent its No. 3 Company
in advance up on to the Welsh Ridge in the afternoon.
This company arrived in the midst of a tremendous bombardment,
amid which the bursts of captured English 18-pounder
high explosive were only too apparent to the
experienced eye. It was greeted by the unpleasant news
that the Germans were bombing up the Hindenburg Support
Systems, had already made considerable headway, and that
the troops awaiting relief, demoralized by utter weariness
and exposure, and by the bombardment which had reduced
them to a handful, were at that moment retreating only too
fast. The company, as was natural in such a bombardment,
was spread out with very long intervals between the
platoons. The leading platoon was at once pushed along
the front line. It had few bombs and no artillery support,
so had to rely upon rifle fire. But it stopped the German
advance. Three times the enemy pressed up the trench,
and thrice was driven back. Moreover, on the report that
the enemy was advancing also up the second line, two sections,
perhaps ten men, were despatched to the assistance
of the troops in that trench. Here likewise the German
bombers were checked. The remainder of the battalion
moved up, and the whole line was taken over. The night
passed fairly quietly.</p>

<p>The heroism of this action is not to be measured by
ordinary standards, since the men were in a state of fatigue
and depression when it started. It was surpassed on the
morrow, when the 9th Inniskillings, assisted by a platoon
of the 14th Rifles, counter-attacked to restore the ground
won by the enemy before their arrival. They were enabled
to carry this out by the action of the Brigade transport
officer, Lieutenant Vaughan, who had brought up, in the
course of the night, by the road through Villers-Plouich,
officially reported impracticable for any transport, fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
limber-loads of ammunition, grenades, and Stokes mortar
bombs. The attack was at first successful, winning back
most of the lost ground and capturing nine prisoners, but
the Inniskillings followed the retiring enemy too far, and
parties of Germans, pushing down a sunken road which
had been overlooked, cut off and captured the leading men,
as well as a section of the 109th Machine-Gun Company,
and drove the attack back to its starting point. Of what
followed, a graphic account is given by Captain (then
Lieutenant) Densmore Walker, of the 109th Machine-Gun
Company, who had heard that his guns had been lost and had
come forward with the company commander to investigate.</p>

<p>"We went up the main front Hindenburg Line. This
really was a filthy place. Corpses were touching, laid along
the fire-step, all men of the 61st Division. I expect the
<em>strafe</em> of the afternoon previous accounted for a great many....
On and on we went and then cut to the left, where
we found an officer called Emerson, of the 9th Inniskillings.
Emerson said we couldn't get further as the Hun was thirty
yards away bombing down the trench. Poor fellow, he
thought his whole company was wiped out, and he had been
hit on the head by a bomb. There was a hole in the top of
his tin hat.... He was right about the Huns. Moore
said we were still one hundred and fifty yards from the
machine-gun positions. Some stick bombs fell around us,
several on top of the parapet and one or two in front of
us in the trench. We had about six men slowly falling
back&mdash;they had no bombs. One was hit while I was there.
I took a squint over the top and saw the Huns throwing
many bombs. They had a light machine-gun in case we
attacked over the open. We threw our few bombs, and that
stopped them for a few minutes. When we stopped throwing
they came on again. They can throw their stick bombs
further than a Mills can be chucked by a normal man. We
went on retreating quite slowly. We could have stopped
them all right with bombs. Mulholland<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> ran off to get
some, and finally some reinforcements of the 14th Rifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
came up and held the cross trench, the Hindenburg Line.
Here we could easily hold the Boche as we were right across
his front. As there was nothing to do here, we decided to
try to get to the machine-gun positions from the left flank,
the right being effectually closed to us. Just as we were
pushing off, Emerson gathered some men together, got
out on top, and chased the Huns back up the trenches.
It was uphill."</p>

<p>This heroic young officer, who had led his company in
the original attack that morning and captured four hundred
yards of trench, had, as Captain Walker remarks, been
severely wounded in the head. For three hours he had
rallied the remnants of his company to withstand the German
bombers. He had made a previous attack over the
open and captured six prisoners. On this last occasion of
which Captain Walker speaks, having driven back the Germans
at least a hundred yards, he fell, mortally wounded.
He was awarded the posthumous honour of the Victoria
Cross.</p>

<p>It may be added that Major Mulholland and Captain
Walker, working their way round to the left flank, found
two of their gun teams intact, though two men had been
killed and thirteen captured by the enemy. The guns had
been posted where no machine-guns should ever have been,
in an outpost line very lightly held by isolated infantry
sections, owing to the previous troops not having realized
exactly how the land lay. The men had taken over their
positions in the dark, no reconnaissance having been possible,
not realizing whither they were being led by their
guides, and had suffered the inevitable consequences when
the German bombers attacked them. A Vickers machine-gun
in a crooked trench is an indifferent weapon with which
to repel an attack along that trench.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to relieve the 9th Inniskillings
after twenty-four hours, so heavily had the battalion suffered.
It had lost all four company commanders. The 11th took
its place. Stokes mortars and rifle grenades had now been
brought up, and at 6 a.m. on the 7th the new battalion made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a very fine bombing attack, clearing three hundred yards of
trenches on a front of two hundred yards, straightening out
the line, and driving the Germans off the crest of Welsh
Ridge. It avoided the mistake of the 9th in going too far.
Two local counter-attacks upon the Inniskillings, within four
hours of their establishing themselves upon their objectives,
were beaten off. The trenches were blocked and Stokes
mortars put in position to cover the obstructions. Germans
massing for a further assault were dispersed by a concentration
of artillery. The achievement of the 109th Brigade,
when the condition of its troops and the state of the trenches
are taken into consideration, must be held to rank high
among the exploits of its career. Weary and sorely tried
handfuls of men had made a most stout-hearted resistance
to well-organized and determined attacks, and the bombing
counter-offensives had been carried out with a dash that
fresher troops could not have excelled. Welsh Ridge had
been denied to the enemy.</p>

<p>The position was even slightly improved by the 107th
Brigade, which took over the sector on the night of the
8th, and won some further ground in the first Hindenburg
Line the following morning. The 107th Brigade also constructed
new blocks. This work was carried out by the
permanent Brigade Works Party, under the command of
Lieutenant Haigh, who had earned the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i> of "Sandbags"
by many similar achievements. The defence, an
affair of makeshift at first, was now thoroughly organized,
with machine-gun batteries linked by telephone to the Brigade
Headquarters in Couillet Wood and on Highland Ridge.</p>

<p>On the front of the 108th Brigade there were fewer
alarums and excursions. In the Couillet Valley its troops
had even room for movement, the Germans contenting
themselves with the establishment of posts in the sunken
roads leading from Marcoing. Two prisoners were captured
by the 2nd Rifles, and one by the 9th Irish Fusiliers.
One post on the higher ground, at the very nose of the
salient, was driven in by the enemy, but promptly re-established.
One of the German prisoners reported that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
attack was to be launched at dawn on the 14th. All troops
and reserves "stood to," and an hour before dawn a great
bombardment was opened by all the artillery on the III.
Corps front. If attack were contemplated it did not develop.
Until two days before its final relief the Division's
front was covered by the 17th Artillery Brigade of the 6th
Division, and three Army Field Artillery Brigades, under
the command of General Brock. On the 14th the personnel
of its own Artillery came in, taking over the guns <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>
of two of these Brigades.</p>

<p>Welsh Ridge was safe now from anything but a "full
dress" attack. But that was precisely what appeared to be
coming. The Germans were plainly in aggressive mood.
Their aeroplanes swept continually down upon our front-line
trenches, firing upon the men in them. Areas in rear,
about Metz especially, were bombed night and day. Their
artillery was very active. Havrincourt Wood was rendered
uninhabitable by its constant shelling. And it was increasingly
plain that the infantry and machine-gunners of
the 36th Division were in no fit state to withstand a new
offensive in force.</p>

<p>Never since it landed in France had the troops of the
36th Division been reduced to a physical ebb so low. The
men became indescribably dirty; lungs, throats, and hearts
were affected. High as were battle casualties, the sick
wastage was higher still, which had not been the case even
at Ypres in August, because then the weather, if wet, was
warm. The troops had, in fact, been exposed to three
weeks of winter in the open, with almost continuous fighting,
while it is doubtful if those of the 36th Division had fully
recovered from the effects of the Ypres episode, three months
earlier. The great captains of old times, who decided that
long spells of open warfare in winter were impossible, were
not fools. Man born of woman cannot withstand for long
that combined strain and exposure without appalling
physical and moral deterioration. Morally the infantry had
survived far better than the authority which left them in
line had right to expect. The men kept surprisingly good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
hearts. Walking round these much-harassed outposts one
was still greeted with a grin when one inquired how many
"pine-apples" had come over in the last twenty-four hours
from the German blocks a little further down the trenches.
But physically they were wrecks. They were living on
their nerves.</p>

<p>A strong report as to the condition of the troops, sent
up through the chain of the medical services, added weight
to General Nugent's representations, which, realizing the
embarrassments of the Higher Command, he had not made
till they were absolutely necessary. Relief came at last.
On the night of the 14th it began, the 189th Brigade of
the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division relieving the 107th Brigade
on the right. Two battalions of this latter Brigade had
been exchanged with two of the 108th, which had endured
a continuous spell in the line, though not in its worst portion.
The following night it also was relieved. Ere they came
out, the 9th Irish Fusiliers bombed an enemy machine-gun
post, killing one man, driving off the others, and bringing
in the gun. This parting fling was, in all the circumstances,
it will be admitted, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau geste</i>.</p>

<p>Rest had come at last, but it had to be won after a last
battle with the elements. The Division was to concentrate
in the area round the delightful little village of Lucheux,
near Doullens. It was now that there swept over Northern
France&mdash;indeed over much of Northern Europe&mdash;a blizzard
of snow that may almost be called historic. Dismounted
personnel moved by train, and reached its destinations
after long delays. Most of the lorries allotted to formations
were, however, "snowed up," and did not arrive for two
or three days. The transport struggled through in face of
extraordinary difficulties. The snow banked itself up on
the hedgeless roads. In those which were sunken it lay
frequently six feet and more in depth. Units were obliged
to march miles out of their courses, bringing the vehicles
through drifts in relays with double teams, trace horses
being sent back for a second batch when the first was upon
firmer ground. Some of the country tracks off the Doullens-Arras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Road simply could not be found. One staging area
had been allotted to two Divisions at once. The mounted
personnel of the Signal Company, turned out by newcomers,
marched fifty miles in these conditions.</p>

<p>Finally all troops reached their quarters and settled
down, the chief work being the clearance of the roads and
the making of tracks past the most formidable drifts where
this was impracticable. By Christmas the men were in fair
comfort, and, good cheer being easily procurable, a pleasant
enough Christmas was celebrated. The troops had reason
to congratulate themselves when they learned the fate they
had narrowly missed. On December the 30th the Germans
launched a heavy attack upon Welsh Ridge, and drove the
63rd Division off a great part of it.</p>

<p>General Ricardo returned at this time to England. The
strain of the Battle of Cambrai and the counter-offensive
had told severely upon his health. Except for a few weeks
when he commanded another Brigade, he had been with
the 36th Division from the beginning, had indeed, as has
been elsewhere recorded, assisted at its birth. His brilliant
powers of organization and his concentration upon the
whole aspect of any problem presented to him, made him
an ideal Brigadier in what has been described as a war of
material. He was succeeded by his friend and brother-officer
of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, Brigadier-General W. F.
Hessey, D.S.O. General Hessey also had been one of the
original commanding officers of the 109th Brigade, and had
come to France with the 11th Inniskillings, leaving that
battalion to command a brigade before the opening of the
Somme battle. General Ricardo's organizing abilities were
not lost to the British Army. He ended the war as Commandant
of the large base of Dieppe.</p>

<p>The lessons of the Battle of Cambrai are clear enough,
though some of its aspects will remain mysterious till all
the secrets of the war are revealed. The piercing of the
Hindenburg fortifications was to a certain extent a gamble,
since no such operation had yet been attempted in such
manner. The very fact that its surprise was complete was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
perhaps the most remarkable feat of all. It was a triumphant
success, though it must be remembered that the
Germans were ill equipped with either armour-piercing
ammunition or anti-tank guns to oppose it. But, if the
break-through was wonderfully achieved, the ensuing exploitation
was not. The resistance of Flesquières and a
broken bridge at Masnières checked the cavalry in its eastward
thrust, but, after all, the Canal de l'Escaut was won,
and exploitation east of it, including the capture of Cambrai,
was of less importance than the northern advance to the
Sensée marshes. "Cambrai," the writer heard a distinguished
soldier say, "was either a surprise or it was not.
It opened as a surprise, but it was not continued as a
surprise should be." It appears probable to-day that had
two fresh Divisions been passed through after the troops
had reached their objectives&mdash;disregarding Flesquières,
which actually did very little harm&mdash;they could have been
firmly consolidated on the Bourlon Ridge by next morning,
and possibly reached the outskirts of Cambrai. Mœuvres
likewise would probably not have been a hard nut for the
teeth of one of the reserve Brigades of the 36th Division
that afternoon. As it was, these troops on that first day
sat in the rain and were not employed. The supreme
difficulty, which was not surmounted, was the passing
through of new formations in a fresh state. This difficulty
was due to the scanty accommodation in the forward area,
which could not be largely augmented without robbing the
attack of one of its most essential features&mdash;surprise. It
was probably this cause which kept the Divisions in the
V. Corps so far back. This question of accommodation
was as important as any tactical problem. There was no
rest for troops in reserve; they were scarcely better off
than those in the fighting. The organization of billeting
during reliefs broke down. No provision was made for
surplus personnel of incoming Divisions. As a result, each
area became congested with their details, and other Divisions,
when allotted such areas, found no accommodation
left. Another great difficulty was the lack of tolerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
roads. The work done upon the roads before and during
the battle was insufficient to preserve them, but it had the
effect of wearying the front-line troops. The preliminary
work, the exposure, cold, dirt, lack of rest and hot food,
told very speedily upon the health of the infantry engaged,
and diminished its fighting value.</p>

<p>The tanks were magnificent. They accomplished all
that their commanders had promised. But their employment
after the first day caused a tremendous strain upon
their teams, which, when not fighting, were greasing and
"tuning up." It is possible&mdash;though this is pure speculation&mdash;that
the number used on November the 20th might
have been reduced by a third, which would have left a
really large reserve for subsequent operations. As it was,
many tanks in the later stages of the battle broke down before
reaching their starting line.</p>

<p>And once more, in conclusion, we must pay our meed
of praise to the German machine-gunner. Machine-gun
battalions were reported by airmen to have detrained at
Cambrai on the evening of the 20th. If so, these picked
troops were doubtless in action all along the front the following
day. It was machine-gun fire alone that delayed the
British advance till fresh troops were on the ground to bring
it to a halt. Of the German machine-gunners General
Nugent wrote: "It is not too much to say that the failure
of our offensive to achieve the objectives laid down, was
entirely due to the devotion and fighting spirit of these
troops of the enemy, practically unsupported by their own
infantry and artillery, during the first forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>This fact proved, if proof were needed, that no troops,
however devoted, could, without mechanical assistance,
face machine-guns <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'in being, handled'">being handled</ins> by really determined
defenders.</p>

<span class="smcap">The German Offensive on the Somme (I):<br />
January to March 22nd, 1918</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Snowbound as they were, the troops of the 36th Division
passed several days in the most agreeable conditions. One
day there might be snow-fall; the next might succeed with
keen frost, but there was no lack of timber for fuel, and the
amenities of civilization were very welcome to men who for
five months had dwelt amid devastation. Training was
practically impossible owing to the depth of the snow in
the fields, but some musketry was carried out on a good
rifle-range near Lucheux. The Artillery, having been relieved
by that of the 63rd Division on Christmas Day, got
no further than the Beaulencourt staging area, where it
remained hemmed in by drifts.</p>

<p>The rest was, as usual, all too short, particularly in view
of the exhausted condition of the troops. Immediately after
Christmas the Division was again on the move, to the area
Corbie-Boves-Moreuil. Brigade groups went by rail, the
transport by road, staging at Puchevillers and Contay. The
latter met with difficulties equal to those following the
relief. Many lorries were stuck in drifts. In some cases
the trains even were considerably delayed.</p>

<p>The British Army was extending its flank, taking over
from the French a front far greater than it had ever held,
even at the time of the German retirement of 1917, when
its right had been on the Amiens-St. Quentin Road. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is not the place to discuss the wisdom of that extension,
or supposing, as few will deny, that it was in itself reasonable,
of its magnitude. Suffice it to say that Sir Douglas
Haig now found himself seriously short of reserves. The
relief of successive French divisions was being slowly
effected, and the progress of the 36th Division was leisurely.
It remained five days at rest in the Corbie area, where it
was joined by its Artillery. Then it went slowly forward,
<em>via</em> Harbonnières, to the area of Nesle, a town left undamaged
by the Germans in their retirement, into which
they had herded civilians, old men, women, and children,
from other towns and villages destroyed by them. Here
Divisional Headquarters were established on January the
12th. That night the 107th Brigade relieved a regiment of
the 6th French Infantry Division astride the Somme before
St. Quentin, remaining under the orders of the French
Divisional Commander. The night following the 109th
Brigade relieved the other French regiment in line, command
passing to General Nugent at 10 a.m. on the 14th, when
Headquarters took over from those of the 6th French Division
at Ollézy. The 108th Brigade was billeted in villages
on the Ham-St. Quentin Road, with headquarters at Dury.
The Divisional Artillery had been joined by the 14th Army
Field Artillery Brigade. The relief of the French artillery
was not complete till the 15th.</p>

<p>Reliefs of French by British formations always presented
great difficulties, owing to the fact that reserves of munitions
of every sort had to be transferred, instead of being
simply handed over as when Briton relieved Briton. Differences
of language and of method were scarcely less important.
Yet it often happened that reliefs on such occasions
were the most satisfactory of all. Each side was on its
mettle. Staff work was meticulously careful, reconnaissances
were thorough, guides of proved intelligence chosen. This
case was no exception. There is hardly a diary of the
formations and units of the 36th Division in which is not
expressed high appreciation of the arrangements made by
the French, and of the kindness with which advance parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
were treated by them. One officer writes of his own reception
by a French regimental commander: "The most
amazing dinner I ever did have in the line! We had course
after course of wonderful things, with suitable wines, till
it was hard to think that the Huns could be only a thousand
yards distant, but that was all they were." And not the
officers only were entertained, for his men informed him
that "the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilus</i> made them eat the whole time and
absolutely bathed them in coffee."</p>

<p>The front taken over ran from Sphinx Wood, some
twelve hundred yards west of the village of Itancourt, to
a point on the St. Quentin-Roisel Railway a thousand yards
west of Rocourt Station. Rocourt is a suburb of the city
of St. Quentin, at the gates of which the British Armies now
sat. The position and its defences will have to be described
later in some detail. Here it need only be said that the
latter were already considerable, but that, the relief taking
place in the midst of a thaw following upon weeks of snow
and frost, the 36th Division succeeded to a legacy of fallen-in
trenches and mud. For the rest, it was on the whole a
quiet front and not uncomfortable. The destruction of the
villages behind our lines did not appear to be as complete
as before Cambrai. A few French civilians had trickled
back to villages such as Ollézy and Douchy, while the town
of Ham, where were the Headquarters of the XVIII. Corps,
was intact and was full of them.</p>

<p>The Germans, who had excellent observation, were, of
course, quickly aware of the relief, and evidently received
orders to obtain identifications of the new troops in front
of them. After several fruitless attempts they succeeded in
obtaining them. On the night of January the 22nd they
entered our outpost line on the front of both Brigades,
capturing in each case a wounded prisoner. A small patrol
of the 10th Rifles was also waylaid by superior numbers,
and an officer and sergeant taken. This appeared to content
them, and thereafter, for a considerable time, the front
became of a placidity such as the troops of the 36th Division
had seldom known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>For the moment&mdash;a fleeting moment, indeed&mdash;the enemy
had second place in the minds of officers and men of the
Division. Its first concern was with its reorganization.
The shortage of man-power had been talked of long enough.
Its fruits had now to be plucked, and bitter they were. The
whole British Army was now cutting down its divisions to
nine infantry battalions, and its brigades to three. From
the tactical point of view, apart from the fact that it entailed
a loss of some hundred and seventy-five battalions,
the change had serious inconveniences. The brigade of
four battalions was the traditional British formation, just
as the regiment of three was the Continental. It was the
formation which British commanders had handled in
training and practice, upon which their conceptions of
infantry in war were based. The moral loss was no less
great, particularly in divisions and brigades with strong
territorial associations and sentiment. It meant that battalions
in every division disappeared, and that either their
personnel was transferred to others, or that they became
"Entrenching Battalions," pitiful, nameless ghosts, robbed
of their pride and their traditions. Such changes could
not be without their effect upon moral, working through
the loss of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit-de-corps</i>, the very life's blood of a combatant
unit.</p>

<p>The 36th Division, it will be remembered, had already
received two regular battalions, the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles
and the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers. It was now joined by
three more, the 1st and 2nd Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers,
from the 29th and 32nd Divisions respectively, and the 1st
Royal Irish Rifles, from the 8th Division. To make place
for them, the 10th and 11th Inniskillings, the 8th/9th, 10th,
and 11th/13th Rifles had to disappear. Three Entrenching
Battalions, the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, were formed from the
disbanded battalions after the remainder, including the newcomers,
had been brought up to strength. The 2nd Rifles
in the 108th Brigade, and the 1st Irish Fusiliers in the 107th,
were exchanged. The infantry of the Division was now as

<p>The new arrivals were all regular battalions of Ulster
regiments, but the characteristics of the Ulster Division were
entirely changed. Its infantry, formed originally from the
U.V.F., had now Ulster-Scot and Celt intermingled, and
received English recruits as well.</p>

<p>At the same time the 16th Rifles (Pioneers) was reduced,
with other Pioneer battalions in France, to three companies.
One accretion of strength the Division received, as some
small compensation. The 266th Machine-Gun Company
arrived from England on January the 18th, and was formed,
with the three existing Machine-Gun Companies, into the
36th Machine-Gun Battalion. The tendency had been for
the machine-guns of a Division to come more and more
directly under the control of the Divisional Commander
during active operations. A Divisional Machine-Gun Officer
had long been employed, but he was rather an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i> to
the staff than a commander. Under the new system there
was a lieutenant-colonel commanding the battalion who
received his orders from the staff of the Division.</p>

<p>On February the 22nd the 30th Division, hitherto the
reserve of the XVIII. Corps, was interposed between the
36th and 61st, taking over the front held by the 36th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Division north of the Somme, in the Forward System. In
the second position, or Battle Zone, the 36th Division continued
to be responsible for a sector north of the Somme,
behind the village of Fontaine-les-Clercs.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The frontage
was thus reduced to about six thousand yards. The relief
of French troops by British had meanwhile extended further
south, and the 36th Division had on its right the 14th Division
of the III. Corps.</p>

<p>The Battle of Cambrai had been the last fling of the
Allies for the time being. They were now definitely upon
the defensive, awaiting a great attack in some uncertainty
as to the precise point at which it should be launched. The
victories of the Central Powers upon other fronts, above all
the collapse of Russia, had freed German troops which,
if not for the most part of high quality, would be able to
man defences while attack was delivered elsewhere by the
superior troops they relieved. Not a week passed without
the announcement of the arrival of new divisions from
Russia or Italy. Between November the 1st, 1917, and
March the 20th, 1918, the number of German divisions in
the Western theatre had increased from one hundred and
forty-six to one hundred and ninety-two.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The total continued
to grow for some time after the launching of the
offensive. The heavy artillery had also been greatly increased,
while a number of Austrian artillery regiments had
come to the aid of their allies. The forces of the Allies
were now considerably outnumbered, though not nearly to
the extent which many writers, then and since, have pretended.
Moreover, they were without unity of command,
and there was among them divided opinion as to the point
at which they would have to meet the onslaught, though
Sir Henry Wilson had insisted that it would be at the
junction of British and French. There had been preparations
for an advance in Flanders. The French had apprehensions
of one in Champagne. On both these fronts
there came, indeed, great attacks at subsequent dates. Even
if the attack were to come, as seemed most probable, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>the front of General Gough's Fifth and General Byng's
Third Armies, its exact scope was uncertain. The final
opinion appeared to be that, while the opening assault
would extend further south, the main weight of the attack
would be north of the Somme, along which would be formed
a defensive flank. There is little doubt, from the writings
of German staff officers since published, that such was
the original intention, and that only unexpectedly great
success south of the Somme induced Ludendorff to modify
it. It appears also that the Crown Prince, in whose Group
of Armies were the forces in the left of the German
advance, urged him to adhere to his first plan even after
the battle had been several days in progress.</p>

<p>Lord Haig in his Despatches has revealed that, not
being able to hold all his extended front in adequate strength,
having to take risks somewhere, he took them on the front
of the Fifth Army, where there was most elbow-room, and
where loss of ground was likely to have least serious effects.
It had become more and more apparent that defence in
depth offered the best means of checking and breaking up
an advance, and it had been laid down by G.H.Q. that all
preparations must be based upon that system. Unfortunately,
with the slender forces at the disposal of General
Gough, defence in adequate depth implied a very shadowy
defence in breadth.</p>

<p>The system of defence of divisions in line comprised
a Forward Zone and a Battle Zone. The object of the former
was to withstand a minor attack, and to check and, so
far as might be, disorganize and disintegrate a major one.
On the Battle Zone the Army Commander was to oppose
the enemy's advance with all the forces at his disposal.
The Forward Zone comprised a front and intermediate
system; the former consisting of outpost line, line of resistance,
and counter-attack companies; the latter of a
system of isolated forts, wired all round, known as the Line
of Redoubts. The Battle Zone likewise consisted of two
main lines of defence, organized internally with counter-attack
units and wired-in redoubts. The description of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
these defences may sound formidable till it is explained that
there was but one battalion for the defence of each of them
to two thousand yards on the front of the 36th Division,
and even less density further south. There were likewise
Rear Zone defences, notably behind the Canal de St.
Quentin and Canal de la Somme. Here it may be added
that confusion has been caused in the minds of many by
the fashion in which the names "Somme River," "Somme
Canal," "St. Quentin Canal," and "Crozat Canal" have
been used by various writers in their descriptions of the
battle; because the canalized Somme, giving birth to
different canals at different parts of its course, was also the
main obstacle in two successive lines of defence. The
Somme runs south-west from St. Quentin to St. Simon,
west for nine miles to Voyennes, then more or less due
north to Peronne. Over the first of these three sections
it is canalized under the name of the Canal de St. Quentin;
over the second two, under that of the Canal de la Somme.
Where confusion is apt to arise is in the fact that at St.
Simon the Canal de St. Quentin leaves its parent river and
runs down to the Oise at Terguier. In the account that
follows, the river, a winding, branching stream, will be disregarded,
and the Canals, which formed the real obstacles,
alluded to always as the Canal de St. Quentin and Canal
de la Somme.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The front held by the 36th Division was in its natural
features not ill adapted for defence. It was crossed by a
series of ridges and valleys running east and west, parallel
to the front line. Behind the front-line system, which was
on the same ridge as the German outposts and on its reverse
slope, was a deep valley known as Grugies Valley, from
Grugies to the St. Quentin-La Fère Road, north of Urvillers,
thence curving northward into "No Man's Land," towards
Neuville-St. Amand. Grugies Valley had therefore its
advantages and its dangers. On the one hand it afforded
good masked positions for machine-guns; on the other, it
was a conduit, from the north-eastern end of which attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
might flow down behind the line of resistance of the Forward
Zone. Behind it was another ridge, upon which was
the Line of Redoubts. Behind this again the ground sloped
away gradually, rising to a slighter ridge, along which ran
the Essigny-Contescourt Road. Upon the forward and
reverse slopes of this last ridge were the positions of the
two southern sectors of the Battle Zone, four thousand five
hundred yards behind the front line. The northern sector,
as has been explained, was north of the St. Quentin Canal.
These positions were good, but they had one great failing.
The front line of the 36th Division ran roughly from west
to east to Sphinx Wood, while thence the line of the 14th
Division ran more nearly north and south. The right flank
was therefore very insecure. Should Urvillers fall, the
right of the 36th Division's Forward System would undoubtedly
crumple, while should such a calamity as the
capture of Essigny occur, the defences of the Battle Zone
would be turned.</p>

<p>The night of February the 22nd, which saw the entry
into line of the 30th Division, saw also a reorganization
of the system of defence. All three Brigades now entered
the line, the 108th on the right, 107th in the centre, and
109th on the left. Each had one battalion in the Forward
Zone, one as garrison for the Battle Zone, and one in reserve.
In each case the Forward Zone battalion had two companies
in the line of resistance, finding their own outposts,
one company for counter-attack in the front system, and
one "passive resistance" company, with battalion headquarters,
in a large fort in the Line of Redoubts. This
unfortunate description implied that the last-named company
was not allowed to counter-attack to retake ground lost in
the front system. The Battle Zone battalions were billeted
close to their battle stations, that of the 108th Brigade in
dug-outs at Essigny Station, along the railway cutting, of
the 107th Brigade in quarries near Grand Séraucourt, and
of the 109th at Le Hamel, on the other side of the St.
Quentin Canal. The artillery was disposed in two groups
covering the Forward Zone, with one of the three Brigades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the 153rd, in reserve as supporting brigade. On February
the 28th, when XVIII. Corps announced a "state of preparation,"
the batteries of this brigade took up positions
south-east of Grand Séraucourt to cover the Battle Zone,
with a section per battery pushed forward to temporary
positions covering the Line of Redoubts.</p>

<p>Upon these positions a vast amount of work had to be
accomplished, an amount so vast that it permitted of very
scanty time being allotted for training. The Battle Zone
had practically to be created. The lines had been merely
sited by the French, and a little wire put up. Work was
concentrated first of all upon this; secondly, upon the fortresses
which were to contain battalion headquarters and
"the passive resistance" company in the Line of Redoubts&mdash;known,
from right to left, as "Jeanne d'Arc," "Racecourse,"
and "Boadicea"; and lastly, upon making good the main
communication trenches, and making wired-in platoon keeps
in the Forward Zone. There was shortage of wire in February
and the early part of March, and bad indeed would
have been the state of the defences but for the large dumps
left behind by the French, for which the countryside was
scoured. As it was, no-one in the 36th Division can be
said to have been satisfied with the state of the Battle Zone
by mid-March. Most of the trenches were no more than
eighteen inches deep, it having been ruled that there would
be time to dig them out when it became necessary to occupy
them.</p>

<p>Uncanny work it was awaiting, in the silence of quietest
of quiet lines, a mighty attack of which for very long there
was scarce an indication. In the earlier days, save for reports
from higher formations of aerodromes, hospitals, and
railways far behind the German lines, the sole warning sign
was in the large numbers of officers, maps in hand, observing
day by day the British trenches and the country behind
them. There was no great increase of movement on forward
roads till about the 12th of March. Aeroplane photographs
taken about this date showed that a large number
of shell-holes a few hundred yards from the outpost line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had been worked upon. It was surmised that these were
being prepared for trench mortars, for the destruction of
the British front-line system, as that of the Russians had
been destroyed before the last great German advance at
Riga. Significant also, in this connection, was the fact that
Oskar von Hutier, who had carried out that attack, was
now in line opposite, in command of Eighteenth Army.
His known character and antecedents were food for reflection.</p>

<p>New military roads were also discovered behind Itancourt.
But it was a few clear mornings and evenings, from
the 15th of March onwards, that brought most conclusive
evidence of what was impending. From the dovecote in
Essigny, the best observation post on the XVIII. Corps
front, which was manned by the 36th Division's excellent
observers, an enormous amount of traffic could now be
observed. Along the main road from Guise-Mont d'Origny
to St. Quentin, in particular, huge convoys of lorries
and horse transport were seen, as dusk drew in, moving
towards the last-named city. Small place for doubt now
remained.</p>

<p>On March the 4th occurred a curious incident. The
Germans had apparently come to the conclusion that the
British front line had been abandoned; and, indeed, it was
held lightly enough by isolated sections. Strong patrols,
amounting in general to a platoon, suddenly issued from
the German trenches all along the 36th Division's front,
in broad daylight. The outposts might be weak, but they
could resist an attempt of this sort. Under the fire of
Lewis guns all the patrols were stopped and dispersed with
heavy loss. Patrols sent out in turn from the outpost companies
captured in all one officer and ten other ranks. It
was a sharp lesson, and thereafter, till the opening of the
attack, was no move by the German infantry.</p>

<p>From March the 12th onward was instituted a series of
nightly bombardments, in which the now considerable
heavy artillery at the disposal of the XVIII. Corps took
part, of valleys and dead ground forming probable assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
positions. Tests of the action to follow the preconcerted
Corps message, "Man Battle Stations," were carried
out. Bridges had long been prepared for demolition and
allotted to particular sections of the Field Companies.
Small mine-fields had been constructed in case of the employment
of tanks by the enemy. Grugies Valley was
starred with machine-guns, to sweep its length with zones
of flanking fire. It was felt by officers and men of the
Division that what the limited means at its disposal permitted
had been accomplished. The worst misgivings were
with regard to the gaps between keeps and redoubts in the
Forward Zone, owing to the paucity of numbers available
for its defence. There was no touch between the battalion
headquarters forts in the Line of Redoubts; they were in
no sense mutually supporting. There was little to prevent
the enemy from breaking through in the intervals,
pushing forward his main advance almost unembarrassed
by them, while special detachments swallowed them at
leisure.</p>

<p>Much noise of enemy traffic was heard at night from
the 17th onward. On the evening of the 18th two Germans
entered our lines on the front of the 107th Brigade to give
themselves up. They declared they had deserted to avoid
the coming battle, which would not now be long delayed.
They confirmed the suspicions of massed trench mortars on
the front. They had seen great numbers of troops, particularly
of artillery. St. Quentin, they said, was packed
with men. On the night of the 20th a raid was carried
out by the 61st Division, resulting in the capture of prisoners
who stated that the attack was to be launched the
following morning. A special bombardment was therefore
carried out from 2-30 to 3 a.m., with heavy rolling barrages
on likely positions of assembly.</p>

<p>The great moment, for which, it is scarce exaggeration
to say, men were waiting all the world over, came at 4-35
a.m. on the morning of March the 21st. The infantry of
the 36th Division was then disposed as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The artillery had begun moving a large proportion of
its guns to new positions on the night of the 17th, having
taken a hint from the fate of batteries on the front of the
Third Army, which had just been subjected to the heaviest
"mustard" gas bombardments experienced in the whole
course of the war. The moves of batteries of the 173rd
Brigade were actually not complete till a few hours prior
to the launching of the attack. The dispositions were then
as follows:</p>

</p>

<p>With one great crash there opened a tremendous bombardment,
of trench mortars by the hundred and every
calibre of artillery save the 77-mm. field gun. Its continuous
roar was punctuated, to those a little distance from
the line, by the explosions of huge single shells upon objectives
in rear. So far as can be ascertained the German
programme consisted of a concentration mainly of trench
mortars on the front system; a bombardment with high
explosive and phosgene gas of the Line of Redoubts, the
valley in rear of it, the trenches of the Battle Zone, and
Battery Valley, which ran behind its ridge; for which 105,
150, and 210-mm. howitzers were employed; and fire on
villages in rear, and upon the crossings of the Canal de St.
Quentin, with the largest howitzers and high-velocity guns.
Particularly heavy fire was directed upon the redoubts and
battery positions. The proportion of lethal shell to high-explosive
gradually decreased, till the barrages were composed
entirely of the latter. There was, according to the
reports of artillerymen, a remarkable absence of 77-mm.
shell and of instantaneous fuses.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the opening of the bombardment the
order, "Man Battle Stations," was sent out by the General
Staff. Dawn had broken in a dense mist. Morning mists
at this season and in this district are the rule rather than
the exception, but this was far thicker than the ordinary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
It was at five o'clock impossible to see more than ten yards
ahead, and visibility increased very slowly till the afternoon.
All the battalions in the Battle Zone appear to have reached
their stations, upon ground thoroughly known to officers
and men, in good time, but, as communications were constantly
cut and runners were slow amidst the fog and the
shelling, reports were long in coming to hand. This loss
of telephone communication rendered it almost impossible
to issue barrage orders to the artillery.</p>

<p>The German infantry attack was launched at 8-30 a.m.
That the enemy attacked the major part of the line of the
36th Division frontally is disproved by the reports of survivors
and returned prisoners. The main assault of the
Germans, it must be remembered, was due west, almost
parallel to the 36th Division's outpost line from Sphinx Wood
to Gauchy. The advance must have swept straight up the
Grugies Valley. There is evidence that Racecourse Redoubt,
which contained the battalion headquarters and one company
of the 15th Rifles, was attacked before the companies in the
front system. Hopeless indeed was the position of the men
in this front system, outnumbered three or four times,
taken in rear by parties which came upon them without
warning. The case of the machine-gunners, from whom, in
the defence of the valley, much had been hoped, was equally
desperate. The Germans swept on them, as it were, out of
nothingness. Few can have had opportunity to fire a shot
ere they were rushed.</p>

<p>It was believed at the time that all troops in the front
system had been speedily overwhelmed. The evidence of
returned prisoners, however, has established that there was
at least one magnificent defence in this area, which, though
then unknown, must have had invaluable results. The three
companies of the 12th Rifles in the front system of the 108th
Brigade were, as will be seen from the map, astride the
national road running from St. Quentin to La Fère, which
for several miles south of this point ran roughly parallel
with the British front line. Captain L. J. Johnston, who
commanded "C," the counter-attack company, states that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
though the preliminary bombardment smashed up their
trenches and cut huge lanes in their wire, though owing to
the mist and the fumes of gas-shell it was impossible to see
more than a few feet ahead, the casualties were relatively
light. Though all communication to rear was cut, the telephone
line held as far back as Le Pontchu Quarry, "C"
company's headquarters. Captain Johnston thus received
word when the attack was launched, and began to move his
company into Foucard Trench. In its progress up the communication
trench it met a small party of Germans, who
were shot or bayoneted. The fact was, however, thus made
unpleasantly apparent that the enemy had broken through
the line of resistance. The keeps held by "A" and "D"
companies, farther forward, were still resisting, but by 11
a.m. were completely surrounded, and finally overwhelmed
by weight of numbers. For four hours constant bombing
attacks were launched on Foucard Trench. On several
occasions parties of Germans entered the trench, but in
savage hand-to-hand fighting were ejected. About thirty
prisoners were taken and sent back under escort to Le
Pontchu Quarry. About noon a most determined assault
was carried out with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">flammenwerfer</i>, to be bloodily repulsed.</p>

<p>An hour later the fog suddenly lifted. It was then clear
to "C" company what progress the enemy had made.
More than a mile to rear the Germans could be seen swarming
about Jeanne d'Arc Redoubt, which held the battalion
headquarters and "B" company. On the front of the 14th
Division German cavalry could be seen advancing, and,
what was even more astonishing, a column of transport,
three hundred yards long, moving down the main St.
Quentin-La Fère Road, about four hundred yards to the
right of "C" company's position. Lewis-gun fire opened
upon this body in a few seconds killed or wounded every
man and horse in it, leaving the whole column in a welter
of confusion.</p>

<p>By now, however, the company was being attacked from
both flanks, and a withdrawal to Lejeune Trench, five hundred
yards in rear, was ordered. The enemy followed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the withdrawal fiercely and with the greatest gallantry, a
rather pathetic incident occurring when a single German
with bayonet fixed charged the whole line! The incident
is instructive, as it reveals the high state of training in the
offensive spirit of the attacking troops, and helps to account
for some of their successes in later days, when our men
were wearied out. "C" company, reinforced by the forward
headquarters, which had been in Le Pontchu Quarry,
now numbered nearly a hundred and twenty men. A further
magnificent stand was here made.</p>

<p>About 3 p.m. a company of the enemy, evidently believing
they had to deal with but a handful, was seen marching
up in fours from the rear. The men held their fire till
the Germans reached point-blank range. Then such a
blast burst forth as brought the whole body to the ground.
Captain Johnston believes that not a man escaped.</p>

<p>The position, however, was now hopeless. All thought
of cutting a way through was out of the question, so thick
were the enemy to rear. The end came at 4 p.m. A German
tank came down the main road, firing into the trench
in enfilade. At the same moment a whole battalion advanced
from the front. There were about a hundred men
only alive, many of them wounded. There was no course
open but surrender. As the prisoners were marched back
toward St. Quentin they had the grim satisfaction of seeing
the column of transport they had annihilated still strewn in
indescribable confusion about the road.</p>

<p>This most valorous defence was, as has been stated,
unknown at the time. After the Armistice one Military
Cross, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, and four Military
Medals were awarded to the survivors of the company.
The defence of "C" company of the 12th Rifles, against
hopeless odds, when all seemed melting about them, must
be held to rank with the very finest episodes of that month
of March, the blackness of which is gilded with so many
deeds of imperishable courage and fortitude.</p>

<p>The front system pierced, the enemy wasted no time
upon the Line of Redoubts. The leading battalions pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
through the gaps between them, leaving it to their successors
to attack them deliberately, with the aid of trench
mortars and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">flammenwerfer</i>. At 11-45 a.m. a report was
received from the 30th Division, on the left, that the enemy
had broken through on either side of the Epine de Dallon
Redoubt, and that the special "redoubt barrage" was being
put down. At 12-10 p.m. the "redoubt barrage" was
ordered on the 36th Division's front also. That the enemy
had passed through the Line of Redoubts before the barrage
was put down is now certain. Twenty minutes later the
107th Brigade received a message from its Intelligence
Officer, Lieutenant Cumming, whose work in reconnaissance
was extremely gallant and useful, that the attack upon the
Battle Zone was developing. At 12-15 p.m. Artillery
Groups were warned to be prepared to withdraw their
batteries to the Battle Zone positions. The personnel of
the 18-pounder batteries of the 173rd Brigade was, however,
obliged to withdraw from its guns, being attacked at
close quarters by riflemen and machine-guns. Breech
blocks and sights were carried away by the gunners in their
retirement. The most serious report of all came from the
107th Brigade. The enemy was in Contescourt, in the
section of the Battle Zone held by the 1st Rifles. It appears
that the platoon of this battalion told off to defend the
northern part of the village, was almost destroyed by a shell
on the way up. A company of the 2nd Battalion moved
forward in an attempt to eject him, but suffered heavily
from machine-gun fire and failed to achieve its purpose.</p>

<p>The position was now very dangerous, but not irretrievable.
Save at Contescourt, where the enemy made no further
progress, the Battle Zone was intact. So, likewise, was that
of the 30th Division on the left, and of the 61st Division
further north, save at one point. At noon all three battalion
headquarters on the Line of Redoubts were most
manfully holding out, beating off attack after attack. General
Nugent had refused to allow more than one company from
a reserve battalion on the 107th Brigade's front to reinforce
that holding the Battle Zone. He had still, therefore, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his Pioneer Battalion, reserves to fill a gap. Moreover,
there was in rear the 61st Brigade of the 20th Division,
allotted to the support of the 36th Division's front, though
not yet at General Nugent's disposal. Up till now it might
be said that, their superiority in numbers and their advantage
from the mist having been taken into consideration,
the Germans had been held as effectively as could have
been expected. The mist was now clearing, and machine-gunners
in positions of the Battle Zone were beginning to
cause loss to the enemy.</p>

<p>But from the right there came news most disquieting.
The Germans had captured Manufacture Farm, in the front
line of the 14th Division's Battle Zone; soon afterwards
they were in Essigny. It is difficult to ascertain precisely
at what moment this important point, on dominating ground,
was occupied by the enemy. The reports of the 108th
Brigade would seem to put it about noon. On the other
hand, an air report to the 14th Division stated that at 1-30
p.m. all the roads south of Urvillers were "teeming" with
Germans, and that batteries were in action in the open
south-west of the village. Now, in an attack, roads do not
begin to "teem" with troops until supports and reinforcements
move up, some time after the leading waves. Moreover,
the detachments of two guns of the Machine-Gun
Battalion, with positions near Essigny, state positively that
there were Germans in that village considerably earlier,
and that they themselves were in action against parties
advancing upon the railway station from it. One gun dispersed
an important attack with great loss before it was
destroyed by artillery fire. The second covered the railway
cutting, up which the enemy presently began to press from
the <em>south</em>. Later it was withdrawn to a point fifty yards
west of the cutting, whence it continued to engage the
enemy advancing from Essigny. It remained in action till
ordered to withdraw at night.</p>

<p>At whatever hour precisely the enemy penetrated Essigny,
it is certain that by one o'clock, whilst all along the
front the Germans were attacking the Battle Zone, the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the 108th Brigade was completely turned. At this time
the telephone line to Station Redoubt, wherein were the
headquarters of the 1st Irish Fusiliers, which had been cut
long before, was repaired, and General Griffith learnt that
fierce fighting was in progress here in the front line of the
Battle Zone, and that the 41st Brigade on the right had
been driven back. By 2-30 p.m. the enemy was in Fay
Farm, south of Essigny, three thousand yards behind the
front line of the 14th Division's Battle Zone. On the front
of the 1st Irish Fusiliers the enemy forced an entry at the
railway cutting, but every attempt to advance was defeated
by the Lewis-gun fire of the garrison. General Griffith
now moved up the 9th Irish Fusiliers to form a defensive
flank. A veritable break-through had occurred on the right,
extending a considerable distance south over the front of
the III. Corps. The general situation, from being menacing,
was become suddenly desperate.</p>

<p>At 4-5 p.m. General Nugent ordered the 108th Brigade
to form a flank along the railway line, half-way to the village
of Lizerolles, to which it should be prolonged by the 14th
Division. On the left flank of the 36th the 1st Inniskillings
was holding stoutly. General Nugent therefore put at
General Griffith's disposal the 9th Inniskillings, the reserve
battalion from the 109th Brigade. This battalion was swung
across the front. Colonel Peacocke, its commanding officer,
reported, however, that the troops of the 41st Brigade were
now holding on, and that he had accordingly taken up a
position behind the 9th Irish Fusiliers. So the position
remained, more or less, till dusk began to draw on. The
enemy was in Contescourt, but the 1st Rifles clung to the
cross-roads south-east of the village. The right company
of the same battalion maintained its position in desperate
fighting. Enemy troops massing along the canal bank
between Dallon and Fontaine-les-Clercs, for the attack upon
the Battle Zone positions of the 1st Inniskillings north of
the canal, were heavily engaged by the batteries of the Left
Group. The fire was observed and controlled from Ararat
Observation Post, on the high ground north-west of Quarry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Redoubt, with which telephone communication was maintained.
At length the Germans succeeded in running a
forward gun into Fontaine, but all efforts to serve it were
frustrated by the fire of the 463rd Battery R.F.A.</p>

<p>Up forward, meanwhile, the three Redoubts of the Forward
Zone, hopelessly beleaguered, completely surrounded
by the enemy, had fought a battle that may be described
as epic. The enemy pounded their trenches with trench
mortars, attacked, was beaten off, bombarded once again,
again attacked. Jeanne d'Arc, on the right, was the first
to fall, about noon. The other two fought on, in the hopes
of effecting a break-through after dusk. But it was out of
the question, so thick was the enemy now in their rear.
Trench after trench was taken by the enemy in Racecourse
Redoubt, till at last only a corner round the railway cutting
remained. Attacks with <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">flammenwerfer</i> were repulsed, largely
through the skill with the rifle grenade of Captain Stewart,
the Adjutant. Such a battle against incredible odds could
not continue for ever. At half-past five, almost simultaneously,
though they had of course no communication
with one another, Colonel Cole-Hamilton, commanding the
15th Rifles, and Lord Farnham, commanding the 2nd Inniskillings,
decided that further resistance was impossible.
Both were highly complimented upon their resistance by
the German officers who took over the forts. Colonel Cole-Hamilton
was told that a battalion had been attacking him
all morning, and that a second had been brought up during
the afternoon. He himself had about thirty men unwounded.
In the case of the headquarters of the 2nd Inniskilling
Fusiliers, the Germans released two pigeons in Boadicea
Redoubt with messages announcing its capture. The messages
were received by the Headquarters of the 36th Division.
The resistance of Racecourse and Boadicea Redoubts affords
a rare example of that "cold courage," unsupported by the
ardour and excitement of an advance or the hope of ultimate
victory, which has been so often displayed by soldiers
of British race in all periods of the history of British
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>At 4-15 p.m. the 61st Brigade of the 20th Division,
placed at the disposal of the 36th Division, was ordered to
man the St. Simon defences, an arc covering the hairpin
bend in the Canal de St. Quentin, and including the villages
of Avesne and the Pont de Tugny. General Cochrane,
commanding the Brigade, established headquarters at St.
Simon.</p>

<p>The position on the right flank grew still more serious
toward evening. Finally the Commander of the Fifth Army
decided to withdraw the III. Corps behind the Canal de
St. Quentin, in conformity with which move it was necessary
for the 36th Division to be swung back also, pivoting
upon the 1st Inniskillings, which battalion still clung to its
Battle Zone. The 61st Brigade was ordered to withdraw
across the Canal, obtaining touch on the right with the
troops of the 14th Division, east of Avesne. From its left,
half-way between Tugny and Artemps, the 108th Brigade
was to hold up to the cemetery at Happencourt. Thence,
up to and inclusive of Le Hamel, was to come the 107th
Brigade. Then the 9th Inniskillings was to prolong the line
to the Battle Zone defences of the 1st Inniskillings. The
61st Brigade was not to withdraw from the arc of the St.
Simon bridgehead till the troops of the other Brigades had
completed their retirement. When this had been effected,
the 61st Brigade was to be in touch not only with the 108th,
along the Canal, but with the 60th Brigade of its own Division,
now at the disposal of the 30th Division, which had
outposts on a line from the Canal south of Happencourt
to Vaux, north of the Ham-St. Quentin Road.</p>

<p>The retirement began at 10-30 p.m., being covered by
small rearguards. In the darkness the troops were not
seriously pressed by the Germans. Long before dawn all
battalions were established in their new positions, the three
Brigade Headquarters of the 36th Division being at Lavesne,
and that of the 61st Brigade in the old Divisional Headquarters
at Ollézy. General Nugent had meanwhile transferred
his headquarters to Estouilly, north of Ham. It must
be remembered that each Brigade had by now had one battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
almost completely destroyed, and that the Battle Zone
battalions were at an average strength of about two hundred
and fifty men. There was an accretion in artillery strength.
Two batteries, A/91st and C/91st, of the 20th Divisional
Artillery, together with the 232nd Siege Battery, were put
at the disposal of the 36th Division, and remained with it
throughout the retreat, though there were constant changes
in the formation of Groups. The Siege Battery was later
transferred to a special Heavy Artillery Group, with two
others, directly under the orders of the 36th Divisional
Artillery.</p>

<p>The destruction of bridges and pontoons allotted to the
Engineers of the 36th Division was carried through without
hitch. Shortly after noon the pontoon and foot-bridge at
Fontaine were destroyed by the 121st Field Company,
which in the small hours of the 22nd of March blew up the
whole group of bridges between Grand Séraucourt and Le
Hamel. Later, in daylight, the 150th Field Company blew
up the Artemps Group. The Tugny and St. Simon bridges
had been allotted to other sections of the company. Lieutenants
C. L. Knox and J. B. Stapylton-Smith were each
responsible for twelve bridges. The first warning received
by the former was when the débris of the Artemps bridges
floated down-stream. He at once commenced his task.
Several of the bridges were destroyed under machine-gun
fire. At Tugny, the Germans were advancing on the main
steel-girder bridge when the time-fuse failed. The night
dew or the mist had spoiled it. As Lieutenant Knox rushed
forward the foremost of the enemy were upon the bridge, a
long one. He tore away the useless time-fuse, clambered
under the frame-work of the bridge, and lit the instantaneous
fuse. The bridge was destroyed, and, by some
miracle, Lieutenant Knox was uninjured. He received the
Victoria Cross. Among many heroic actions performed by
officers and men of the Division in the course of the war
it would be difficult to point to one of finer calibre. At
St. Simon, Lieutenant Stapylton-Smith blew up a large
number of the enemy with one of the three main bridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The early hours of March the 22nd, which dawned in
thick mist like the day before, passed fairly quietly. For
the moment, the right flank of the Division and the III.
Corps on its right being behind the barrier of the Canal de
St. Quentin, the greater pressure was shifted to the north.
In bitter fighting the troops of the 1st Inniskillings held
their ground in the forward positions of the Battle Zone, till
2 p.m., when, completely outflanked, they were ordered to
withdraw to Ricardo Redoubt, the headquarters redoubt in
the Battle Zone, upon which attack after attack was launched,
to be beaten off with heavy losses by the defenders. The
Germans across the Canal were meanwhile far in their rear,
having batteries in Artemps by now. Finally, Ricardo
Redoubt was surrounded, the 9th Inniskillings being compelled
to fight a rearguard action back to the Happencourt-Fluquières
Line, upon which, as has been recorded, were
troops of the 60th Brigade. On the right the Canal Line
held, though the enemy had brought up batteries, trench
mortars, and machine-guns under cover of the mist, and
was bombarding it heavily.</p>

<p>At noon General Nugent was informed that, in consequence
of the decision of the Higher Command to hold
the line of the Canal de la Somme and its continuation
southward, the Canal de St. Quentin, a further withdrawal
was necessary. The 36th Division, with the 61st Brigade
attached, was now to hold this position from the present
right flank of that Brigade to Sommette-Eaucourt. The
61st Brigade had already a battalion, the 7th D.C.L.I.,
holding from the Canal junction to a point west of the Dury-Ollézy
Road, less one company, which had been moved
down to the right flank to fill a gap between its right battalion,
the 7th Somerset L.I., and the troops of the 14th
Division. Its other battalion, the 12th King's, was driven
out of Tugny at dusk by the advance of the enemy north
of the Canal de St. Quentin, crossed the Canal de la Somme
at Dury, and was withdrawn through the 7th D.C.L.I. to
support on the railway behind that battalion. The withdrawal
of the Brigades of the 36th Division was complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
at 11 p.m., when the last troops passed through Pithon.
The 108th Brigade took over the defence of the Canal bank
from the left of the 7th D.C.L.I. to Sommette-Eaucourt.
The 107th Brigade moved to Eaucourt and Cugny, the
109th to Brouchy in support. As no touch could be obtained
with the 30th Division, which was to have prolonged
the line westward, by the 108th Brigade, the 21st Entrenching
Battalion, which had now come under General Nugent's
orders, was put in on the left of the Brigade.</p>

<p>Ricardo Redoubt, in which the heroic resistance of
Colonel Crawford's 1st Inniskillings continued all day, was
now, of course, completely isolated. At three o'clock the
commanding officer sent away a detachment, some men of
which succeeded in making their way back to our lines.
The remainder fought to the end. Finally driven to the
north-western corner of the Redoubt, they ejected the
enemy bombers who had now a footing there. Two men
alone, Privates Bailey and Conway, drove out one group
of the German bombers. Trench mortars pounded them
from all sides, which they could not reach. A mere handful
was taken prisoner with Colonel Crawford about 6 p.m.
It is difficult to overestimate the value of this magnificent
stand against overwhelming odds.</p>

<p>The position at two o'clock on the morning of March
the 23rd may be summarized for the sake of clarity. The
36th Division, with attached troops, held the line of the
Canal de St. Quentin and Canal de la Somme from a mile
and a half north-west of Jussy to a mile west of Sommette-Eaucourt.
Upon this line it had, from right to left, the 61st
Brigade (7th Somerset L.I. on right, 7th D.C.L.I. on left,
12th King's in support); the 108th Brigade (9th Irish
Fusiliers on right, 1st Irish Fusiliers on left; with a composite
battalion of details and men returned from courses
finding the outposts, to allow some rest to the other battalions);
21st Entrenching Battalion. The length of the
front was upwards of five miles. The 16th Rifles (Pioneers)
was at Sommette-Eaucourt, where the battalion had been
working since before noon on a line of strong points. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
109th Brigade, consisting now of the 9th Inniskillings, was
at Brouchy, in reserve. The 107th Brigade Headquarters
and the 2nd Irish Rifles were at Cugny. The other battalion
of this Brigade, the 1st Rifles, now very weak, was
at Eaucourt. Divisional Headquarters were at Fréniches.</p>

<p>The artillery position is somewhat complicated, owing
to early losses and subsequent changes. The Potter Group
(A/153rd Brigade R.F.A.; B/153rd Brigade R.F.A.; D/173rd
Brigade R.F.A.; D/91st Brigade R.F.A.; and 383rd Battery
R.F.A.) had been ordered to join the 20th Division.
It was in action in Bacquencourt during the day, rejoining
the 36th Division in the afternoon after a big march. The
front was now covered by the Erskine Group (A/91st and
C/91st Brigade R.F.A.; and D/173rd Brigade R.F.A.) on
the right, in positions in and around Aubigny; and the
Eley Group (463rd and 464th Batteries R.F.A.; C/153rd
and D/153rd Brigade R.F.A,; B/91st Brigade R.F.A.;
and two howitzers of B/232nd Army F.A. Brigade) on the
left, in positions near Brouchy. The Heavy Artillery Group
was out of touch, and could no longer cover the divisional
front.</p>

<p>The Machine-Gun Battalion had disappeared as a unit,
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'bur there'">but there</ins> were still detachments with each of the Brigades,
acting as a rule under the orders of the battalion commander
on the spot.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the Engineers of the 36th Division
had taken over from the XVIII. Corps the destruction of
bridges in Ham and along the river and canal to Ollézy.
They were all effectively destroyed, save the main railway
bridge at Pithon, which was found not to have been prepared.
French railway troops, working in haste and with
insufficient explosives, did all the damage in their power
to it, but it is believed to have been swiftly repaired by
the enemy.</p>

The Position before the German Attack, March 21st, 1918.</div>
</div>

<p>The battle had been till now an attack with great
superiority of numbers upon partially-prepared positions, or
naturally formidable obstacles, such as the canals and the
marshy bed of the Somme. From the morning of the 23rd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>open warfare developed, from the moment the enemy, as
happened early, had driven the 14th Division back from
the Canal de St. Quentin at Jussy. That accomplished,
the Canal de la Somme at this point formed no real obstacle
to the German advance, because, from St. Simon to Voyennes,
it was parallel with it. For the 36th Division there
were no more defences till the front line of 1916 was reached.
It had to fight its battle of the 23rd and 24th of March in
open country. The account of that battle and of the remainder
of the retreat must occupy a chapter to itself.</p>

<span class="smcap">The German Offensive on the Somme (II):<br />
March 23rd to 30th, 1918</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In the account which follows, it is scarcely to be hoped
that all the confusion arising from reports that often conflicted
can be eliminated. The resistance made by the 36th
Division and its attached troops was one in which a large
number of units, some existing, some hastily improvised,
took part. But, for the most part, they were very small units,
except for the battalions of the 61st Brigade, less depleted
and less wearied by the morning of March the 23rd than
those of the 36th Division. This chapter opens with events
occurring forty-eight hours after the beginning of the great
German bombardment. In that period the troops of the
Division had been constantly engaged in fighting, or, when
not fighting, on the march, or upon the alert for a fresh
attack. On the nights neither of the 21st nor the 22nd
had more than a couple of hours' sleep been snatched by
any of the infantry. Many units had had absolutely none.
The men were already wearied out. The 1st Rifles, to take
one example, after fighting all day on the 22nd in the neighbourhood,
first of Le Hamel, then of Happencourt, had
marched by night to Pithon, there crossed the Canal de la
Somme, then continued its march to Eaucourt, which was
reached at three in the morning. The distance covered
was nine miles. Even on arrival there was not rest for all,
as piquets had to be posted round the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It is hard for those who have not seen a great retreat
of this nature to imagine how depressing are the circumstances
and the sights which he sees about him to the soldier
entrusted with the fighting of delaying actions, how great
his mental and moral, apart altogether from his physical,
strain. The flood of civilians pouring out of towns and
villages was in itself a pathetic and depressing sight. At
three o'clock on the afternoon of the 22nd the nurses of
the C.C.S. in Ham were walking down the Guiscard Road,
carrying bundles, some of them assisting wounded men.
Lorries and ambulances had already taken the worst cases,
but at this stage there was not transport enough for all. Such
sights as these were calculated to prey upon the mind and
react upon the moral of the stoutest hearted. Allied with
great physical fatigue and the sensation of being three
or four times outnumbered, their effect was even more
dangerous.</p>

<p>The exploits of the troops of the Fifth Army are great
enough without straining the note. Some writers had made
it appear as though the men were of triple brass. Men are
of less durable material. Each has what may be called his
"weakening-point," which is arrived at sooner in some men
than in others. There were cases of weakness in the days
that followed among troops of the 36th Division, as among
other troops. But their achievements must be measured by
the standard of their cruel and heart-breaking task. With
that as gauge, these achievements, viewed as a whole, stand
out in their magnificence, a shining monument to the spirit
of the race that bred them.</p>

<p>The 21st Entrenching Battalion, interposed on the left
of the 108th Brigade to find touch with the troops of the
30th Division, had not succeeded in its object. It was discovered
at dawn that the line of the 30th Division turned
back from the Canal about Verlaines. The 23rd Entrenching
Battalion, consisting of men of disbanded battalions of the
36th Division, under the orders of the 30th, beat off all
hostile attempts to cross the Canal in the neighbourhood
of Offoy. Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Odo Vivian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the officer commanding that battalion, reports that at
7 a.m. troops fell back on his right from Ham, saying that
they had been driven out by the enemy. About eleven,
two Canadians informed him that they had slept the night
in the town and seen no sign of the Germans. Be this as
it may, it seems certain that the crossings at Ham, of all
places on the front, were least effectively guarded, and that
the enemy had some troops over the Canal here by noon.
To cover the left flank, the dismounted sections of the
Engineers and a battalion of divisional details were put into
position north of Golancourt.</p>

<p>It was, however, on the other flank that danger first
appeared. The enemy, according to the reports of the 14th
Division, effected a crossing at Jussy at 3-30 a.m., but was
counter-attacked and driven back by the 7th K.R.R.C. This
respite was temporary only. By 11-15 a.m. the enemy was
over the Canal de St. Quentin at many points, though the
7th Somerset L.I. clung stoutly to its position. Half an
hour earlier the 2nd Rifles had been ordered to take up a
defensive line east of Cugny, in touch with troops of the
14th Division, which had fallen back astride the road from
that village to Flavy-le-Martel. By noon the troops on the
right were falling back from Flavy-le-Martel and Annois,
hard pressed by the enemy. The retirement continuing, the
1st Rifles was moved up on the right flank of the 2nd Battalion.
On its right were at first no British troops, but a
line was hastily taken up by dismounted French dragoons.
In this position the line remained on this flank for some
hours. The 1st Rifles was constantly engaged and managed
to hold its ground. The 2nd Battalion did not come into
action till later in the afternoon, as there were still in front
of it a few men of the 14th Division who had retired from
Flavy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the centre, the line from Sommette-Eaucourt
to Ollézy, and that of the 61st Brigade upon the
Canals, held in splendid fashion. It was now the turn of
the left flank. The 9th Inniskillings was heavily attacked
from the north-west at Aubigny. One company fell back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in disorder from the village. Thereupon the Brigade-Major,
Captain G. J. Bruce, rode forward, rallied the men,
and galloped into the village at their head. The Germans
were driven out. It was a wonderful example of the inspiration
of personal gallantry and leadership upon weary
and disheartened men. Gradually, however, the line at this
point fell back under severe pressure. Sommette-Eaucourt
was lost, and a little later Brouchy. Both flanks of the
Division were now completely turned.</p>

<p>At 4-30 p.m. General Cochrane, commanding the 61st
Brigade, ordered the 7th D.C.L.I. and the 7th Somersets
to withdraw to the line of the Ham-Terguier Railway, from
the brook west of Annois to the Ollézy-Eaucourt Road.
The Somersets, however, upon the Canal de St. Quentin,
lost the better part of three companies, which fought on
when surrounded till all their ammunition was gone ere
surrendering. The D.C.L.I. extricated itself under great
pressure, and took up position upon the new line.</p>

<p>And now upon the right the attack was renewed in great
force. Enemy battalions passed through Flavy and deployed
on either side of the Cugny Road. At about 5 p.m.
the Germans attacked that village, using trench mortars to
cover the advance, to be repulsed by the 2nd Rifles. A gap
had now formed between this battalion and the 1st, through
which the enemy pushed at dusk. The 1st Rifles was also
attacked at 7 p.m., and also drove off the enemy, but this
mere handful of brave men was now menaced both from
south-east and north-west, and, to avoid being surrounded,
withdrew towards Beaulieu, a mile south-east of Cugny.
The 2nd Rifles also was compelled to evacuate the village,
taking up a position astride the Villeselve Road at its western
outskirts.</p>

<p>When night fell the line ran east of Beaulieu, to the
western edge of Cugny, to the railway south-east of Ollézy,
and along it to the Ollézy-Eaucourt Road, thence along the
road, including the village of Eaucourt, a thousand yards
south of Brouchy, to north of Golancourt. Behind it was
a line of French infantry, pushed up hurriedly, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
artillery or more ammunition than was carried on the men,
roughly from Esmery-Hallon, through Flavy-le-Meldeux and
Villeselve, to Beaumont-en-Beine. The Headquarters of the
36th Division were withdrawn from Fréniches to Beaulieu-les-Fontaines,
north of the Roye-Noyon Road, at six in the
evening.</p>

<p>In the course of the day all arms of the Division had
been constantly in action. The 16th Rifles, which had been
put at the disposal of the officer commanding the 9th Irish
Fusiliers, had been fighting all day upon the Somme, and
had fallen back in the general withdrawal on the left flank.
Details of the Machine-Gun Battalion, under the second-in-command,
Major Low, had, as has previously been recorded,
also been in action on the left. All details, men
returning from courses and leave, had been pushed into the
battle. The clerks and runners of the 109th Brigade Headquarters
had fought at Brouchy.</p>

<p>Great steadiness and devotion to duty had been shown
by the Artillery. Two batteries of the 91st Brigade (from
the 20th Divisional Artillery), A/91st and C/91st, are specially
mentioned in the report of the C.R.A. When infantry, in
the first case that of the 109th Brigade, in the second that
of the 61st Brigade, fell back upon their positions, the battery
officers rallied the men, and the gunners aided them to dig
in in front of the guns.</p>

<p>Amid all the confusion food supplies had not failed,
though no rations could be distributed to the troops in line
till the small hours of the morning of March the 24th. The
107th Brigade was able, besides keeping its own troops supplied
with tools for entrenching, to send a number of picks
and shovels to Rifle Brigade battalions of the 14th Division
in the neighbourhood of Cugny. On this day and throughout
the retreat the work of the Train and Supply Column
was most praiseworthy, while the Staff Captains of Brigades
showed forethought in their arrangements. The medical
services, under great difficulties, had done all that was possible
in the evacuation of wounded.</p>

<p>The night passed fairly quietly. It was doubtless employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
by the Germans to bring up fresh guns, for upon
the morrow the volume of artillery fire was noticeably
greater. There was no German infantry attack with the
light, as might have been expected, on the morning of March
the 24th. It did not come on either flank in any strength
till about ten o'clock. Very probably the enemy had been
relieving his front-line battalions, and their successors were
not ready to renew the struggle till some hours after
dawn.</p>

<p>It was, however, discovered at dawn that parties of Germans
had entered Golancourt in the darkness, and that our
men had evacuated the village. This was a very serious
blow, as it threw into confusion schemes formulated overnight
between General Hessey, commanding the 109th
Brigade, and General Cochrane, commanding the 61st.
These two commanders had planned a counter-offensive to
ease the pressure on the left flank, and blunt the pronounced
salient into which the line was being forced. General
Nugent had put at General Hessey's disposal a composite
battalion under Major Knox, and had later strengthened his
line by sending up three hundred details from Beaulieu,
servants, orderlies, grooms from Headquarters, and the personnel
of the Signal School. These were formed into two
companies, under the command of Captain W. Smyth, R.E.,
attached to the General Staff, and Captain C. Drummond,
A.D.C. to General Nugent. Major Knox's detachment was
to move <em>via</em> Golancourt, approach Aubigny as closely as
might be in the mist, and attack the village at eight o'clock.
Meanwhile the 9th Inniskillings, with a company of details,
was to reoccupy Brouchy. General Cochrane arranged to
retake Eaucourt with a hundred men of the 284th Army
Troops Company, R.E., who had come under his orders,
commanded by two of his own infantry officers. This he
had succeeded in doing before midnight on the 23rd. Touch
was obtained by the attacking force with the 7th D.C.L.I.,
on the railway where crossed by the Ollézy-Eaucourt
Road.</p>

<p>But Major Knox came under heavy machine-gun fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
from Golancourt on his march, and was unable to make
headway. The attacks upon Aubigny and Brouchy were
therefore cancelled, and the companies of details thrown in
on the left of the 9th Inniskillings. The position of the
7th D.C.L.I. on the railway was now impossible. The
battalion was being pressed on either flank, and its right was
in air. At eleven o'clock General Cochrane ordered it to
fall back from the railway, and to take up a line in touch
with the fragments of the 12th King's, a thousand yards
west of Cugny, roughly parallel with the Cugny-Eaucourt
Road. The right company of the D.C.L.I. had to fight a
rearguard action to cover the withdrawal, and suffered considerable
loss from machine-gun fire. Upon its heels the
Germans pushed forward their machine-guns and a number
of single field guns which had been brought across the
Canal.</p>

<p>At this time the 2nd Rifles was still maintaining its
position, three hundred yards west of Cugny. Behind it,
between Cugny and Montalimont Farm, the 1st Battalion
had dug itself in. It will thus be seen that there were two
thin lines of men, literally back to back, with about a mile
between them, one facing east toward Cugny, the other west
toward Golancourt. Such a situation could not possibly
persist. On the right there was intense confusion. Here
the French had been relieving what was left of the troops
of the 14th Division, between Cugny and Ugny-le-Gay,
when the Germans attacked, and the two lines, relievers
and relieved, had been rolled back before noon. La
Neuville-en-Beine had been lost. The difficulties were not
lessened by the fact that small parties of troops of the 14th
Division, which had become intermixed with those of the
36th, received the order that they were relieved by the
French, and were to fall back upon Guiscard. Their withdrawal
left new gaps, of which the enemy, whose light
machine-gun groups were handled throughout the day with
consummate skill, was not slow to avail himself.</p>

<p>The salient held by the 36th Division suddenly caved.
From all sides the semicircle fell back upon Villeselve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which was heavily bombarded by the enemy from noon
onward. Desperate efforts were made by Brigade Staffs
to rally the men in front of Villeselve, and get them into
trenches with the French infantry. To a great extent they
were successful, but the impossibility of co-ordination
between troops which always fought in method so different
was plainly apparent. When the trenches were shelled the
French troops walked out of them. When the shelling
ceased they walked back. Such procedure was all very well
for formed units under their own leaders; it was impossible
to make it understood by scattered details of men of a dozen
units, harassed and strained by four days' fighting. Eventually,
at about three o'clock, the French received orders to
retire. Our men likewise fell back from the village.</p>

<p>Meanwhile upon the right had been enacted a drama
truly heroic which has never been recorded, because, in the
days when reports and despatches were written, there was
no survivor to tell its story. On the morning of the 24th,
the 2nd Rifles consisted of the following officers: Captain
T. Y. Thompson, D.S.O., commanding since the officer
commanding at the outset of the attack, Major Rose, had
been wounded; Captain J. C. Bryans, Lieutenant M. E. Y.
Moore, M.C.; Lieutenant R. B. Marriott Watson, M.C.;
Lieutenant J. K. Boyle, M.C.; Lieutenant E. C. Strohm;
and perhaps two hundred other ranks. Of these, Lieutenants
Moore and Marriott Watson were old companions-in-arms.
They had served together in the 13th Rifles;
had together taken part in that battalion's great raid on
June the 26th, 1916, and had both been wounded on July
the 1st. Having withdrawn from the eastern to the western
skirts of Cugny overnight, the battalion had steadfastly maintained
its position, almost entirely unsupported. After
beating off an enemy attack at ten in the morning, it was
discovered that ammunition was woefully short, and orders
were issued to fire at especially good targets only. Captain
Thompson, deliberately exposing himself to encourage the
men on the menaced right flank, which was being again
attacked, was killed, as also was Lieutenant Marriott Watson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Captain Bryans now assumed command. Messages sent up
from the 1st Rifles in rear, ordering the battalion to withdraw,
did not reach it. The men who bore them were killed
or wounded. In any case, it was the opinion of Captain
Bryans that a retirement across the bare, open country
between Cugny and the village of Villeselve, with the
Germans on three sides of him, was impossible.</p>

<p>From noon onwards was a lull, which was occupied in
reorganization of the line. Then, about 2 p.m., preceded
by a violent barrage of artillery and machine-gun fire, supported
by an attack from low-flying aeroplanes, an assault
was launched, the Germans sweeping in from the left in
overwhelming numbers, despite the gaps cut in their ranks
by fire. By the time the enemy was upon them there was
scarce a round left to fire. "Many," writes Captain Bryans,
"had only their bayonets left. Rather than wait for the
end, they jumped from the entrenchments and met it gallantly.
It was an unforgettable sight. We were overwhelmed,
but not disgraced."</p>

<p>After a desperate hand-to-hand fight, the little band was
simply engulfed. Lieutenants Moore and Boyle were killed.
Of about a hundred and fifty men on their feet when the
attack began, it is estimated that over a hundred were killed
or wounded.</p>

<p>With the enemy pressing south-eastward from the direction
of Golancourt, and westward from Beaumont-en-Beine,
the situation was as acute as it had been at the worst moment
of the morning. It was relieved by a great charge carried
out at 3 p.m. by troops of General Harman's 3rd Cavalry
Division, which had been assisting to maintain the line of
the 14th Division during the morning. The 7th and Canadian
Brigades had been moved in the direction of Beaulieu,
to check the German pressure on the salient. A detachment
of the 6th Brigade, about a hundred and fifty men,
under Major Watkins Williams, 10th Hussars, charged from
the neighbourhood of Collézy the enemy advancing through
the two copses north-west of Villeselve. The detachment
came under heavy machine-gun fire, and many saddles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
emptied. But it achieved its object. The Germans were
caught in the open, a considerable number cut down or shot,
and over a hundred prisoners taken. Infantry of the 36th
Division, weary as they were, followed up the charge
cheering. It was a most brilliant little action. But it was,
and could be, no more than a delaying action. There was
no question of reoccupying Villeselve. The 9th and 62nd
French Divisions had orders to withdraw before heavy
attacks, holding the enemy where possible, but never risking
a break in their line. Toward evening Berlancourt and
Guiscard were heavily shelled. The enemy had now some
150-mm. batteries in action, and employed instantaneous
fuse against Guiscard. Here Captain Rabone, Brigade-Major
of the 108th Brigade was wounded. The Headquarters
of the 9th French Division moved out of Quesmy,
south of Guiscard, only just in time to avoid being surrounded.
Patrols of the enemy, using white flares after
dark as a guide to their artillery, were in Guiscard before
11 p.m.</p>

<p>At 11 p.m. the 36th Division was put at the disposal of
the 62nd French Division, and ordered to withdraw its
troops through its line. The 108th Brigade, leaving the
remnant of the 9th Irish Fusiliers to fight a rearguard action
on the ridge between Guiscard and Berlancourt, withdrew
to Crisolles, and later to Sermaize, where the men had some
rest. The 107th and 109th Brigades withdrew to Sermaize
and Frétoy-le-Château, arriving about 2 a.m. in the morning
of the 25th.</p>

<p>During the day the artillery attached to the 36th Division,
to which the Potter Group, after having been in action
under the 20th Division, had been returned, had actively
barraged the roads leading south from the Canal de la Somme
upon which the enemy was advancing. The Potter Group
had bombarded the enemy massing for attack in the neighbourhood
of the Esmery-Hallon&mdash;Golancourt Road, causing
considerable casualties to parties in the open. The Erskine
Group continued in action near Beines till French and
British infantry had withdrawn through its guns. C/91st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Battery remained covering the retirement till after dark, and
was fortunate to be able to extricate its guns after the Germans
were in Berlancourt. The Eley Group had to make
three withdrawals, first, before noon, to Berlancourt; then,
at 2-30 p.m., to Buchoire, where it covered the French
infantry; and at 6 p.m. to the neighbourhood or Frétoy-le-Château.
In every case the retirement was delayed till the
last possible minute. The men of "C" and "D" Batteries,
153rd Brigade R.F.A., displayed the highest courage and
most dogged perseverance throughout this day.</p>

<p>At night the Erskine Group was put at the disposal of
the 9th French Division, the Eley and Potter Groups at
that of the 62nd French Division, under the control of the
36th Divisional Artillery Headquarters. General Brock, on
return from leave, assumed command of the two latter
Groups. Colonel H. C. Simpson, who had hitherto acted
as C.R.A., became Liaison Officer with the 62nd French
Division.</p>

<p>An order of the 62nd French Division, issued at 2-15
a.m. on March the 25th, contained the following information
and instructions for the 36th Division. The general line
held ran west of Quesmy, Bethancourt, Fréniches, to the
Canal de Robécourt at Rouy, east of Nesle. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of
the 62nd Division was to check the enemy's advance, and
prevent his crossing the Canal de Robécourt before, at
earliest, the evening of the 25th. The British batteries were
to remain in action under the orders of the 62nd French
Division. The remaining troops of the 36th Division were
to be withdrawn for reorganization, in readiness to assist
the 62nd Division in case of emergency.</p>

<p>The reorganization, such as it was, was carried out in
the course of a fifteen-mile march. The 21st Brigade, now
reduced to less than five hundred of all ranks, was ordered
to rejoin its own Division north of Roye. It was detached
from the line of retreat at Avricourt, where it was met by
a column of 'buses. Officers and men saw it go, to the
further desperate fighting which awaited its survivors, with
sentiments of the warmest admiration. During the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
period of their attachment to the 36th Division, General
Cochrane's men had displayed wonderful endurance and
devotion. In the centre of a line which was turned upon
both flanks, they had held each one of their successive
positions till the last possible moment.</p>

<p>The troops of the 36th Division halted at mid-day in
the neighbourhood of Avricourt, where they had a few hours'
rest. They then received orders to resume their march.
The 107th Brigade moved back to Guerbigny, on the banks
of the Avre; the 108th Brigade to Erches, a mile north of
that village; the 109th Brigade to Guerbigny and Warsy.
Troops arrived between midnight and two o'clock, and, for
the first time since the beginning of the attack, had a continuous
sleep of at least six hours in comfortable billets.
The 9th Irish Fusiliers, however, coming straight through
from the neighbourhood of Guiscard, a distance of upwards
of thirty miles, did not arrive till 8 a.m. General Nugent
established his headquarters in Warsy.</p>

<p>The spectacle of the infantry upon that march was one
that would have aroused compassion in the most war-hardened
breast. Men's faces were deeply marked by overwhelming
fatigue and lack of sleep. Some moved in a sort
of trance, stumbling forward oblivious to their surroundings.
In some cases their boots had given out. Many company
officers, in the course of the last few miles, dispensed with
the regulation halts, because they found it almost impossible
to get their men on their feet again after them. They lay
like logs, and had to be violently shaken before they could
be recalled to consciousness. Fortunately more 'buses had
been sent for the 61st Brigade than that scanty remnant
required, and a few were able to assist in moving back the
men absolutely unable to walk.</p>

<p>There were other sights upon that line of march perhaps
even more moving. The men in this evil case were, after
all, soldiers, undergoing such experiences as many soldiers
have undergone in many great retreats. The spectacle of
the civilians, turning out in haste from their homes, was
often heartrending. Their big wains would be piled high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with their household possessions, with perhaps the old grandmother
of the family holding its youngest baby, perched
perilously on top. Mile after mile, at the cart-tail, or driving
cattle that became mixed up with the British transport, the
children trudged in the rain. It was only the rich and comparatively
fortunate that had horsed transport. The poorer
struggled along with the most valuable of their things upon
handcarts. The present writer remembers seeing a woman
carried out on a bed and put on to a farm-cart. He was told
she had given birth to a child two hours earlier. A little
later he came upon an old woman pushing her paralyzed
husband in a wheelbarrow. Let those who desire to realize
what effort this requires for a woman of sixty, try wheeling
a heavy man in a wheelbarrow even a hundred yards. For
these room was found in a British lorry at the next village,
but there were many cases where such relief was impossible.</p>

<p>The mien of these unfortunates was wonderful. Here
and there a woman sobbed as she walked, a man cursed
his chance. For the most part, about the most incongruous
of these little cavalcades there was the high dignity of sorrow
and suffering stoically and nobly borne.</p>

<p>In the course of the mid-day halt, details were as far as
possible sent to their own units. In the 107th Brigade the
2nd Rifles, which had disappeared at Cugny, was reformed
at about the strength of a large platoon. A company of the
15th Rifles, under Captain Miller, which had been a part of
the first-formed battalion of details, was attached to the
Brigade. The 109th Brigade formed small companies from
the remnants of the 1st and 2nd Inniskillings.</p>

<p>The fighting of March the 25th exhibited in lamentable
fashion the difficulties that occur in a retreat when two
armies, using different methods, speaking different languages,
based upon different lines of communication, with
different apprehensions preoccupying the minds of their
commanders, are being forced back before a victorious and
more powerful enemy. The French were retiring south-west;
the British west. Sooner or later a gap was inevitable. It
occurred on this evening, at Roye. The 62nd French Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
covered by the Potter and Eley Groups under General
Brock, fought an admirable delaying action. The Germans
did not reach Libermont till 4 p.m., nor was the Canal
crossed by them till about 6 p.m. Thereafter the 62nd
Division, its left flank turned by the German advance at
Nesle, withdrew to the line of the Roye-Noyon Road.
During the remainder of the retreat the 36th Division saw
no more of the artillery which had been attached to it, nor
of its own C.R.A. and staff. An account of their action
with the French must be left till a little later in this
narrative.</p>

<p>The gap had formed, and in the early hours of the morning
the enemy poured through Roye from the north-east,
scarcely checked by the efforts of a French Cavalry Division,
flung out upon a front of six miles. New French
Divisions were about to detrain upon the Amiens-Montdidier
Railway. If the Germans should strike home at that,
a disaster far greater than any which the Allies had yet
suffered would ensue. To close the gap there remained
nothing but the remnants of the two original southern
Divisions of the XVIII. Corps, the 36th and the 30th.</p>

<p>At 8 a.m. on the morning of March the 26th, the 36th
Division received orders to take up a line from the neighbourhood
of l'Echelle St. Aurin, on the Avre, where it was
to obtain touch with the French, to the main Amiens-Roye
Road, north of Andechy, linking up with the 30th Division.
The 109th Brigade was ordered to take up a position from
the river to Andechy, with the 108th Brigade on the left;
the 107th Brigade remaining in reserve at Guerbigny. North
and south of the western outskirts of Andechy ran a good
trench, covered by a certain amount of wire, the second
French line of 1916. Some three hundred yards north of
the village, however, this line bent north-eastward, and
could not be occupied. The advanced troops of the enemy
were already at hand, and it was a matter of minutes whether
the troops would be able to take up the position. The
suddenness of the advance may be gathered from the fact that
farmers from Guerbigny were yoking their horses to ploughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
on the ridge north of the village when they were informed
of the situation by troops moving forward. The present
writer well remembers the gallant and dignified, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh bien,
monsieur, il faut partir alors</i>," of one old man about to hitch
in his team, when informed that the Germans were about
a mile away.</p>

<p>By the time the troops of the 109th Brigade were in
position the enemy was in Andechy. Those of the 108th
were actually prevented from reaching their station on the
Roye Road by machine-gun fire on their left flank. Touch
with the 30th Division was never obtained here, but later
on it was discovered that its right was at Bouchoir, a mile
further back on the main road.</p>

<p>All through the morning small parties of the enemy
attempted to work their way forward, but were held up by
the fire of Lewis guns. The 122nd Field Company, under
the orders of General Griffith, had been posted in echelon
to protect the left flank. At 1 p.m., as the enemy appeared
to be progressing slightly on the left, General Nugent
ordered the 107th Brigade to hold the old French line following
the road from Erches to Bouchoir. The 107th Brigade,
to which was attached the 121st Field Company, the
16th Rifles, and the 21st Entrenching Battalion, as well as
the personnel of its own Trench Mortar Battery, contained
now the remnants of seven units. It was accordingly
formed into three groups, the largest, under the command
of Colonel McCarthy-O'Leary, 1st Rifles, consisting of its
own three battalions. It was in position by 4 p.m., later
pushing forward a line to gain touch with the left of the
108th Brigade.</p>

<p>The troops had now been in position for six hours; six
hours of time the value of which no standard can measure.
When their physical state is considered, the steadiness they
showed on this occasion is equal to any of their achievements
through the week that had passed. Every German
attempt to advance was frustrated by their fire. No artillery
was supporting them. Even a single battery of 18-pounders
would have been of great service, and would have had many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
splendid targets round Andechy. The Germans, for their
part, were now heavily bombarding the village of Erches,
which the 108th Brigade Headquarters were obliged to quit,
moving into the open fields behind it.</p>

<p>At dusk the enemy launched an attack in strength upon
Erches, preceded by a bombardment. By eight o'clock he
was in the village. The 108th Brigade Headquarters was
attacked at close quarters, and General Griffith slightly
wounded in the hand fighting his way clear of the German
patrols. Colonel Place, the G.S.O.1 of the Division, going
up from Guerbigny in a car, with Colonel Furnell of the
1st Irish Fusiliers, and Major Brew of the 9th, to ascertain
the position, ran into a party of the enemy. A bullet stopped
the engine of the car. Colonel Place jumped out, but
before he could draw his pistol from under his coat was hit
in the leg, and fell in the roadway. Instantly a German
sprang upon him and stabbed at him with his bayonet.
Fortunately for Colonel Place, the thickness of his "British
Warm" saved him. The little party had no alternative
to surrender. The car was subsequently recovered, towed
back, and served the Division well in after days.</p>

<p>Colonel Place had been G.S.O.1 of the 36th Division for
more than two years. As a staff officer he was far more
than merely able and efficient. His sympathy and imagination
enabled him to grasp all points of view, and to understand
those which were different to his own. He never
seemed to require, as do so many men engaged on difficult
tasks, an hour free from interruption, but could switch his
mind on to each new problem presented to him, and return
to his own where he had left it. His loss in this unlucky
fashion was much regretted.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cumming, whose reconnaissance on the 21st
has been mentioned, led a patrol of six men into Guerbigny,
to see if the enemy had yet entered it. They had not, but
on his way the patrol was attacked by a German patrol of
five. As a result of the fight every single German was
killed.</p>

<p>The remnants of the 108th Brigade had taken up a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
west of Erches, putting themselves under the orders of
General Hessey, as their own Brigade Staff had been cut
off from them by the German patrols which had burst
through. There was now heavy shelling and trench-mortaring
of the British positions, the enemy having moved up
guns and mortars into Andechy. A patrol sent out at
1-45 a.m. on the morning of the 27th by the 121st Field
Company, saw long columns of the enemy; infantry, transport,
a troop of cavalry, and a battery of artillery, moving
into Erches. Captain Miller's company of 15th Rifles, west
of the village, was pounded with artillery and mortar fire,
the trenches being obliterated and heavy casualties suffered.
He had with him one machine-gun, and, as light appeared,
this gun began to obtain many targets in Erches, inflicting
considerable loss upon the enemy. At 8 a.m. the enemy
entered a sap in front of his trench and began to bomb his
way up. Lieutenant Young, with a handful of riflemen,
promptly drove him out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, clinging to a trench on the Erches-Guerbigny
Road, was Captain Densmore Walker of the Machine-Gun
Battalion, whose diary has previously been drawn upon
in the course of this narrative, with a handful of men of his
company, armed with rifles. Behind him was a party of
the 107th Brigade with one machine-gun. Captain Walker
had with him a rifleman of the old 14th Rifles, now in one
of the Entrenching Battalions, named Gilmour, one of those
curious individuals who, when all seems to be melting
about them in moments of great emergency, suddenly display
resource and coolness which amaze all who have known
them. Together they had already carried out a patrol into
Guerbigny, into which some of the enemy had been seen
to move, in the course of which, Captain Walker cheerfully
confesses, Rifleman Gilmour, rather than he, had been the
leader. The counter-attack which followed may be described
in Captain Walker's own words, because it succeeds,
as no official account ever can, in picturing the exact details
for the mind's eye.</p>

<p>"Things were looking as black as conceivable. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
it would be about 7-30 a.m. when the attack came. We
heard shouting straight behind us and saw about a dozen
men a mile away, coming towards us in a line.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> One waved
a white flag and they all shouted. Some said they were
English, and we were relieved; some said they looked like
French; and I said that any way we would fire on them&mdash;which
we did. They were perfectly good Huns! They
took cover when we opened, and then, when we were really
interested in them, the real attack came from Erches. He
swarmed on to the road and came down the trench. This
looked like the finish of it. There was a general movement
backwards, but Evans prevented the machine-gunners from
dismounting the one machine-gun with the 107th Brigade,
and got it into action on the top of the trench. This
changed the aspect of things, as the Huns checked. We all
got out of our trench (most people with the idea of clearing
over the open, I fancy), and there we stood for quite a while,
our people firing towards Erches, and the Huns hesitating.
Seeing this latter tendency, Gilmour and I moved slowly
towards Erches, trying to urge the troops to attack, but
they were too undecided.... Then we saw a Hun in
the trench just below us. I fired my revolver at him and
he ran back. So we chased him. This settled matters!
The Huns turned tail and our men followed. As my particular
Hun turned round traverses I got in another couple
of shots, but didn't bring him down. When we reached
the road&mdash;which was sunken&mdash; ... the bank came up
to his waist, and he looked scared&mdash;horribly&mdash;but I fired
again.... I distinctly saw what I thought was a puff
of smoke go out from his pack. Any way he at once went
down behind the bank, and Gilmour rushed up with his
bayonet. I said 'Leave him,' but I don't know whether
he did or not. And now I didn't know what to do. Fritz
was legging it for Erches hard enough, and by this time
indeed they had all reached it. I don't know how big the
village was, but we might have rushed it. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hand, I didn't know what had happened on the left, or in
what strength the enemy was.... At this stage I was
delighted to see an infantry officer with an M.C. come up.
I asked him if he thought it was any use trying to go on,
and he said it would be better to make a line there."</p>

<p>Eventually Captain Walker, surrounded, except on the
north-west, withdrew. He adds:</p>

<p>"I think on the whole the Erches scrap went in our
favour. We were few in numbers compared with the Huns.
They were backed up by victory, while our men were
terribly tired, hungry, and dispirited.... Our ammunition
was about gone. For our M.G. we had three
belts left when we retired. We were entirely surrounded,
if only by Hun patrols, and we only knew hazily what direction
to make for. In the circumstances, to delay a force
superior in numbers and moral for half a day after it attacked
our position, was as much as could be expected.
I reckon the Boche should have wiped out our party at
Erches, but we turned on him severely enough to persuade
him to let us go quietly."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>It was, then, at Erches that the enemy first broke the
line on a serious scale. On the right, south of the Avre,
the French posts were withdrawing. The 109th Brigade had
no alternative but to cross. It was impossible to retire
along the right bank. The crossing was superintended by
the Brigade Major, Captain G. J. Bruce, and carried out
in orderly fashion, with covering fire from successive sections.
The line then fell back with the French outposts
through the wood north of Lignières, which was heavily
shelled by the enemy.</p>

<p>North of Erches, Captain Miller held his ground till
noon, when his trenches were being blown in. On his left
what remained of the 1st and 2nd Rifles had fallen back
a little after Colonel McCarthy-O'Leary had been wounded&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the second time. Captain Miller therefore withdrew
upon Arvillers, when he gained touch with Captain Patton,
who had about sixty officers and men of the two other battalions.
Finally, on the order of General Withycombe, the
whole line withdrew upon Hangest-en-Santerre, since large
columns of the enemy could be seen advancing towards
Davenescourt, and disappearing in the wooded country in
its rear. This withdrawal was complete at 5 p.m. By
evening a French Division had moved up, and the remnant
of the 107th Brigade was ordered to march back on relief,
and rejoin the rest of the Division at Sourdon. One party
of three officers and sixty-eight other ranks, however, out
of touch with the Brigade, remained in action north-west of
Arvillers till the morning of the 28th. Constantly pressed
by the enemy, they kept him stationary by their rifle fire.
Not till 11 a.m. were they relieved by the French.</p>

<p>The achievement of the troops of the 36th Division, a
mere handful at this time, almost broken by fatigue, in many
cases without food, must take a high place, not alone in the
annals of the March retreat, but in that of the war. That
men here and there, bowed beneath the weight of a burden
almost unbearable, showed weakness, is not controverted.
The account of Captain Walker has been purposely inserted&mdash;as
an instance, to which many might be added&mdash;to show in
what fashion weakness was overcome by leadership and
example. It is the finest type of courage that, in the slang
phrase, "comes up to scratch" again and again, beating
down in the breast the inevitable weakness as it arises. The
individual Briton is at least as brave as the individual of any
other race; but men in the mass are not naturally heroic.
It is discipline, training, pride in a unit or a formation,
and, above all, in such crises as these, leadership alone
which can instil into men who have undergone the strain
these men had undergone, the courage to stand firm in
the plight wherein they found themselves. These men
had stood. Not only to the officers and picked men among
them, who made the stand possible, but to the whole
group spirit which they created for their weaker brethren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in adversity, the adjective "heroic" may fairly be applied.
Best of all, their object had been achieved. There can
be no suggestion of hyperbole if that object be described in
a phrase from Lord Haig's Despatch. The resistance, he
said, of the 36th Division near Andechy played "no small
part in preventing the enemy from breaking through between
the Allied Armies." If we ponder that phrase and its inferences
we shall have small need of further testimony.</p>

<p>After their long and trying march to Sourdon the troops
had one more call to answer. An enemy column had found
a gap at Montdidier and taken advantage of it. By 8 a.m.
on the morning of the 28th it was over two miles west of
the town. At 12-30 p.m. General Nugent received an
order signed by General Débeney, commanding the First
French Army, to the effect that he was massing artillery at
Coullemelle, and that he required all infantry at his disposal
to cover it. All troops of the 107th and 109th Brigades
that could be collected were moved down to Coullemelle,
and took up a position covering the French batteries.
They were in position at about five in the evening. Subsequently
came a message from the French requesting that
they should be moved to Villers-Tournelle, two miles
south-east of Coullemelle. But the French troops on the
spot informed our men that the situation had improved,
the enemy having been counter-attacked and driven back.
Patrols sent out to Cantigny, another mile and a half east
of Villers-Tournelle, found the French infantry solidly
placed and unattacked. The night being very wet and cold,
the majority of the force was therefore withdrawn into the
houses of Coullemelle, piquets being posted south-east of
the village, and patrols keeping touch through the night
with the French in front.</p>

<p>The following day the march was continued. And now
the weary troops saw heartening sights upon the route.
Column after column of lorries, little Annamite drivers at
the wheel, packed with the dark blue uniforms of the Chasseurs
Alpins, roared by them. At some points there were
serious blocks in the traffic. At Essertaux, where General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Nugent had his headquarters for a few hours, he was succeeded
by General Mangin, commanding the IX. French
Corps. The French were really now in strength. Attack
and counter-attack were to rage here a few days longer.
Up north, upon the Scarpe, Below's great final thrust had
been heavily defeated. The German advance was stayed
at last.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th, after a night spent in the
open in cold and wet, the troops of the 36th Division were
entrained at Saleux, south of Amiens, now half-deserted and
racked by bomb and shell, and moved north to the area
of Gamaches, on the Norman coast, for reorganization.</p>

<p>Remains only to be related the last actions of the Artillery.
On the evening of the 25th it had withdrawn with
the 62nd French Division through the forest south of the
Roye-Noyon Road, coming under the orders of a new French
Division, the 77th, on the morrow. On that day, when the
infantry was beginning its grapple at Andechy, an important
battle opened against the Germans debouching from
Noyon, upon the line Cannectancourt&mdash;Canny-sur-Matz.
Here the Germans made little progress. Attack after attack
on the afternoon of the 27th was beaten off, the barrage
fire being very effective and earning high praise from the
French commanders. On the 28th the Germans succeeded
in entering Canny, but made no progress elsewhere. On
the morning of the 30th desperate German attacks penetrated
some distance into the French positions, taking the vital height
of Plémont Hill. In the afternoon, however, a brilliant
counter-attack was carried out, splendidly supported by our
artillery. The whole line was restored, and over seven
hundred prisoners taken.</p>

<p>The French now had their own batteries in action. On
March the 31st the Artillery began its march back to Poix,
the concentration area for refitment. It had carried out
a great task in a manner worthy of the highest traditions
of the Royal Regiment.</p>

<p>If this narrative has been faithful, and if&mdash;a task far
harder to accomplish&mdash;it has appealed to the imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
there remains little need to discuss the causes of the greatest
defeat suffered by British arms since York Town. The
German victory was a victory of superior numbers, but it
was more than that. It was a victory of training. While our
thin-strung battalions were digging, Ludendorff trained his
great host, collected astride the Oise. He taught it what
armies were forgetting, how to advance without barrage or
tanks. He instilled into it the offensive spirit, and saw
that it reached the very corporals commanding light machine-gun
groups. They it was who won him his battle.</p>

<p>But, if the defence was overwhelmed by superior numbers,
it seems clear that it broke down earlier than it need
have done, and that the fault lay in its organization. The
Forward Zone was little more than a screen, and was so
regarded. Yet it was held by three whole battalions on the
front of each Division. The orders were that the enclosed
keeps, even in the front system, were to resist to the last.
The whole position in front of the Battle Zone may be
regarded as the outpost line. This outpost line, manned
by a third of the infantry force of each Division, was not to
retire and was not to be reinforced. The first shock of the
attack swept this third away. It was defence in detail, not
defence in depth, and in detail it was defeated. Defence
in depth may be defined as successive lines of organized
defence, upon which the defenders can fall back in succession,
always finding some fresh troops on the new position,
so that the line becomes gradually stronger as it falls back,
until at last is reached the line upon which the real defence
is to be made. Gallantly as they strove, much as they
accomplished, the three battalions in the Forward Zone
of the 36th Division were wasted under the Fifth Army
scheme.</p>

<p>As for the lines of the St. Quentin and Somme Canals,
which might have been very formidable, there had been no
preliminary organization of their defence, nor even reconnaissance
with that end in view. When the moment came
the defence had to be improvised.</p>

magnificence of the defence of the 36th Division, and indeed
of the whole of the XVIII. Corps, which had sixteen
German Divisions, in front and second line, against its four.
There is at least every reason to suppose that, had all gone
elsewhere as on the front of the XVIII. Corps, the full
weight of reinforcements would have arrived before the
enemy had forced the lines of the St. Quentin and Somme
Canals. In that case the war would undoubtedly have had
a speedier ending.</p>

Battle:<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> April to June 1918</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The 36th Division had a glance only, infinitely tantalizing,
at the beautiful valley of the Bresle, with its pastures and
woodlands, and snug villages in which the troops were
billeted, from Gamaches, several miles inland, to the little
pleasure-resort of Ault on the coast. A short rest in these
surroundings would have been delightful. But there was
no rest for anyone for a long time to come, nor could be.
The last trains did not arrive in the area till the morning
of April the 1st; the last trains left it, bearing the remnants
of the Division towards Ypres, on the 4th. For the old
battlefield, still known as the Salient, was its new destination.</p>

<p>The interval had been spent in reorganization and the
absorption of the Entrenching Battalions, originally formed
in February from the surplus personnel of the infantry,
which had accompanied the Division north. They did not
go very far to fill the gaps caused by the prodigious casualties.
The word gaps, in fact, is inapplicable. The infantry
of the Division had disappeared. The 108th Brigade had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
been reduced to a little over three hundred, mostly transport
and employed men. The total casualties in the Division in
the ten days from March 21st were 7,252. Of these, 185
officers and 5,659 other ranks were reported missing. Perhaps
four-fifths of these were prisoners of war, wounded or
unwounded. It was a very weak Division which detrained
at Proven and other stations further west.</p>

<p>From the day of its arrival, however, it began to receive
very large drafts from the flood of recruits that now poured
across the Channel. Bitter criticisms have been heard of the
policy which had kept so many troops in England till then.
Whatever their justice in some cases, they have none where
the drafts now received by the 36th Division are concerned;
for of these eighty or ninety per cent. consisted of boys of
nineteen, with far from adequate training. In some cases
these youths, almost before they knew their officers by
sight, were to be put to the severest test, and were to emerge
from it with quite astonishing credit.</p>

<p>Divisional Headquarters, in which Lieutenant-Colonel
A. G. Thompson, D.S.O., Indian Army, had succeeded
Colonel Place as G.S.O.1, were established at Ten Elms
Camp, near Poperinghe, on April the 3rd. On the night
of the 6th the Division began relieving the southern part of
the front held by the 1st Division. By the morning of the
8th the relief was complete, the 107th Brigade being in front
line, the 109th in support, and Divisional Headquarters on
the Canal Bank a mile north of Ypres.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The new front line included the village of Poelcappelle,
which consisted now of a few "pill-boxes" and naught
besides. The area behind it had been the scene of the most
savage fighting on the British front, and was simply a waste
of shell-holes, traversed by "duck-board" tracks. In rear,
however, camps had sprung up amidst the desolation.
Ypres, of all places under the sky, boasted an officers' club.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
There was a railway station at St. Jean, which those who
had seen the campaign of 1917 remembered as one of the
most unpleasant spots upon the front, and a mass of sidings
at Wieltje, which had been infinitely worse. Not for long
was the area to enjoy these amenities, nor Ypres its unwonted
isolation from the enemy. On the 9th the troops heard a
tremendous bombardment to the south. The enemy's
offensive on the Lys had opened.</p>

<p>From Givenchy, where they were magnificently held, to
the neighbourhood of Gapaard, on a front of some twenty
miles, the Germans had broken through. On the front of
the Portuguese Corps the line was shattered, and the German
wave flowed up the low valley of the Lys. The battered
city of Armentières fell. For two or three days no real
resistance could be organized across the gap, and the Germans
pushed west upon Hazebrouck, a most important railway
junction. Estaires, ten miles west of Armentières, was
occupied by the evening of the 10th. By that time troops
of the 36th Division were upon the scene of action.</p>

<p>The 108th Brigade was in II. Corps reserve. At noon
on the 10th it received orders to move at once to Kemmel,
with "C" Company of the Machine-Gun Battalion. 'Buses
were provided for dismounted personnel. The 'bus column,
moving <em>via</em> La Clytte, reached Kemmel village at 4-15 p.m.,
the Brigade coming under the orders of the G.O.C. 19th
Division. That Division, with the 9th, had been fighting
hotly for the defence of the Messines Ridge. The admirable
steadiness of their young recruits and the gallant fashion in
which their counter-attacks had been launched form a
brilliant page in the history of the war, and helped to turn
the Lys offensive, huge as were its gains, into one of the
most expensive and fruitless of the great series of German
assaults. General Griffith was ordered to put his Brigade
into the Kemmel defences. His headquarters were established
in Kemmel Château.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight General Griffith received orders
to move up to the Messines Ridge, in support of the weak
South African Brigade of the 9th Division, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
thrown into the battle under the orders of the 19th. The
1st Irish Fusiliers took up a line on the Messines-Wytschaete
Road, from five hundred yards north of the
former village to the neighbourhood of the 36th Division's
old acquaintance, Pick House. The 12th Rifles was on the
Spanbroek Ridge in support; the 9th Fusiliers about the
old British front line on the Wulverghem-Messines Road.
The morning passed fairly quietly, but there was ominous
news as to the German advance north of Ploegsteert.
General Griffith received a secret warning order that, in
the event of the enemy capturing Hill 63, the whole line
would have to pivot back across the Spanbroek Ridge and
its prolongation east of Wulverghem, south of which village
touch would be obtained with the 25th Division.</p>

<p>At half-past three, after heavy bombardment, the enemy
launched an attack upon the crest-road. The South Africans
on the left were pushed off it, and the line of the 1st Irish
Fusiliers broken. A very gallant counter-attack by Fusiliers
and South Africans, side by side, restored the position,
though subsequent pressure on the left of the latter forced
them to bend back somewhat from the road toward Hell
Farm. At 7 p.m. came another assault, in face of which
the Fusiliers lost not a yard of ground. None of the officers
who took those raw boys into action can have dared to
expect of them such steadiness and resolution as they now
displayed.</p>

<p>At night, however, came orders to carry into effect the
movement anticipated in the warning order. The advance
of the enemy to the south had made it only too necessary.
The ridge must go, though the 9th Division was still to
cling to its northern crown, the village of Wytschaete. The
retirement was carried out before dawn, but it was discovered
on its completion that there was no touch with the
left flank of the 25th Division. After a great deal of trouble,
this was attained by withdrawing the right of the 108th
Brigade some hundred yards.</p>

<p>All day was heavy shelling, but no infantry attack developed
till after six o'clock. On this occasion, as always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the Germans placed great reliance upon a local assault delivered
as dusk was falling, which just permitted attackers
to consolidate a position won, and gave no time for a counter-attack
before the pall of darkness descended. Such a night
as this, which would be lit scarce at all by the thin sickle
of a new moon, was peculiarly favourable to these tactics.</p>

<p>They were, however, unsuccessful. Once again the
defence of the 108th Brigade prevailed. The left of the
9th Fusiliers was driven back. Quickly a counter-attack was
launched. The reserve company of the 9th, led by the commanding
officer of the battalion, Lieut.-Colonel P. E. Kelly,
and a company of the 12th Rifles, led by Major Holt Waring,
most gallantly restored the position. By eight o'clock all
was quiet. But casualties had been heavy. The 1st Fusiliers
in particular had had very serious losses the previous
day on the Messines Ridge. This battalion was reorganized
as a company, and attached to the 9th. During the night
there was no touch with troops of the 25th Division, the
gap having formed owing to the advance of the enemy on
Neuve Eglise and the consequent lengthening of the line.
In the early hours of April the 13th a battalion of the 178th
Brigade, now attached to the 19th Division, was moved up
to fill it.</p>

<p>The 13th was a day of continuous alarms. Parties of
the enemy made attempts at dawn to advance by short
rushes on the front of the 12th Rifles, east of Wulverghem,
but were beaten off with loss by Lewis-gun and rifle fire.
A couple of hours later fresh attacks appeared to be brewing.
Parties of Germans were dispersed by the fire of machine
and Lewis guns. The former were excellently placed by an
officer who knew every foot of the ground, Captain Walker,
in old positions which he had often held before the Battle
of Messines in 1917. Then, all through the afternoon, small
parties of the enemy strove to make ground under cover of
the old camouflage screens upon the Messines-Wulverghem
Road. They were counter-attacked and driven off, suffering
considerable casualties from the fire of Lewis guns. The
position on the right flank was, however, more desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
than ever. At nine o'clock had come from the 25th
Division the evil news that the Germans were in Neuve
Eglise.</p>

<p>During the night the 9th Fusiliers was relieved by troops
of the 178th Brigade, and withdrawn to the dug-outs on
Kemmel Hill. The 12th Rifles remained in line. The relieved
battalion was not given long to rest. Before noon it
was ordered to man the Kemmel defences, and to send up
its company of the 1st Fusiliers to dug-outs behind the old
British front line opposite Kruisstraat Cabaret. The 14th
may be accounted a quiet day, since it passed without infantry
attack. But the volume of artillery fire was immense,
and distributed to a great depth in rear of the positions
held. "Green Kemmel Hill," as one officer wrote, "was
turning brown before our eyes." And the enemy was
definitely in possession of Neuve Eglise.</p>

<p>At 10-30 p.m. orders were received from the 19th Division
for an immediate withdrawal west of Wulverghem.
This was carried out before dawn, the line pivoting back
on the left of the 12th Rifles, which joined up with the
178th Brigade west of the village. It was completed only
just in time. With morning light the Germans opened an
intense bombardment on the new position, which, for the
greater part of its length, followed no old British trench.
An infantry attack followed, and bodies of Germans broke
through at the junction of the 12th Rifles and 178th Brigade.
A counter-attack by the 1st Irish Fusiliers and the scanty
reserves of the 12th Rifles, led by Major Holt Waring, failed
to restore the position, but prevented the enemy gaining
further ground on the left. Major Waring, a most gallant
officer and a born leader of men, was killed. The left and
centre of the 12th Rifles were very wisely withdrawn a few
hundred yards to a famous communication trench of old
days, known as "Kingsway." From this there was a fairly
good field of fire. The 9th Irish Fusiliers had now been
moved up from the Kemmel defences, and was ordered to
send up two platoons to connect the right flank in "Kingsway"
with the original line west of Wulverghem. These two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
platoons had an unfortunate fate. At dusk they were
almost surrounded by groups of the enemy pressing forward,
and were forced to fall back some hundred yards with heavy
casualties.</p>

<p>At 2-15 a.m. on the 16th the little remnant of the Brigade
began to withdraw on relief, covered by small outposts.
It then marched back to a camp near La Clytte,
suffering numerous casualties on its route from shell-fire.
Four machine-guns remained near Kemmel village. The
enemy was now indulging in what were known to artillerymen
as area bombardments, concentrating upon half a
square mile of country for half an hour, then switching his
batteries to another. Such methods are ineffective unless
based upon an enormous mass of heavy artillery. With this
available, as it was on this occasion, they are extraordinarily
noxious and demoralizing. Reserves, tired units withdrawn
for a short rest, are kept constantly on the strain, ever wondering
when their turn is coming, compelled hurriedly to
shift position when it does. Severe loss and disorganization
are caused to transport piqueted in the open or bringing
up rations and munitions. A spot undisturbed at one
minute becomes the centre-point of a hellish tornado at
the next.</p>

<p>April the 16th, while the men of the 108th Brigade,
wearied out and dazed by shell-fire, snatched what rest they
could, was the occasion of furious fighting at Wytschaete.
The village was lost in the morning, and retaken by a magnificent
counter-attack of those veritable paladins of modern
war, the Highland Brigade of the 9th Division. It could
not be held on the morrow owing to its isolation, and the
line had to be withdrawn to the neighbourhood of the old
British trenches of 1917. The 17th, to many observers,
appeared the blackest day they had seen. Almost everywhere
the gains of years of desperate fighting had been lost.
Passchendaele and Poelcappelle&mdash;to which there will be further
reference when we return to the fortunes of the 36th
Division&mdash;were gone. Huge slices of territory on which the
Germans had never stood, or over which they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
hustled in retreat, were now in their possession. Bailleul,
which had been at many periods a Corps Headquarters, had
fallen. From villages such as Westoutre, where they had
lived in comparative peace since 1914, the villagers were
rushing out under shell-fire, pushing barrows, staggering
under the burden of huge bundles, across the fields. Men
asked whether we had any reserves remaining, whether the
young American formations would ever be ready, whether
the Channel ports could be saved.</p>

<p>And yet, though none who watched can have guessed
it, hardly even the great soldier now in supreme command
of the Allied Armies, or his British colleague, the day may
have marked a turning-point. The French were hurrying
north. Their troops were already in line on the right of
the 9th Division; their field artillery, the "seventy-fives,"
rushed up, each at the tail of a lorry which carried the
detachment, were lining the hills, the Scherpenberg, Mont
Rouge, and Mont Vidaigne. The German infantry was
suffering heavy loss. Black as was the night, there was,
if as yet no faintest light of dawn, the paler gray on the
horizon which is its herald.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day orders were received for the
formation of the Brigade, which could now muster about
four hundred rifles, into a composite battalion. This battalion,
under the command of Colonel Kelly, was ordered
to move down behind Kemmel Hill, in reserve, to be in
position by 4 a.m. next morning. It encountered a storm
of shelling on its way, having seventy casualties. Among
the killed here was Captain Despard, 9th Irish Fusiliers,
who had shown great tenacity and fine leadership during
the retreat of the previous month. All day the battalion
remained here, under very heavy fire, from which Kemmel
now afforded but slight protection. At evening it was withdrawn,
French troops having taken over the defence of this
part of the line. The remnants of the Brigade marched all
night, to Siege Camp and Hospital Farm, between Poperinghe
and Elverdinghe, rejoining the 36th Division at 5-30
a.m. on the 19th of April.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brigade had, for the second time in a month, been
cut to pieces. The 12th Rifles alone had had upwards of
fifteen hundred casualties in that period. One often saw
in our summaries of intelligence reference to reports that
such and such a German formation had had particularly
heavy losses, followed by a statement that it might be considered
negligible for some time to come. Few can have
had losses higher than those of the 108th Brigade, which
had, as has been recorded, practically disappeared by the
end of March. Yet in ten days' time this Brigade had
entered another great battle, to prove itself very far from
negligible. The admiration one feels for its achievements
is mingled with surprise when one thinks of the youth and
lack of experience in its ranks. Well did it merit its share
of the commendation expressed in a telegram received from
the G.O.C. IX. Corps the day before it was finally relieved.
The message ran as follows:</p>

<p>"The C. in C. has just been at Corps H.Q. He would
have liked to see all ranks now fighting on the 9th Corps
front, and to tell each one of them of his personal appreciation
of the magnificent fight they have made and are making.
He would like to shake hands with each individual and
thank him for what he has done. He has not time for this,
but has asked me to give everybody this message."</p>

<p>The 36th Division, when the 108th Brigade departed on
its desperate lone venture, was left with its front line east
of Poelcappelle, and its headquarters on the Canal Bank.
On that very day, March the 10th, the Army Commander
decided to withdraw the II. Corps to its Battle Zone, here
practically the British front line of 1917. The right of the
36th Division would now be just in front of Wieltje, so
well known of old. An outpost line was, however, to be
maintained upon the Steenebeek.</p>

<p>The retirement was absolutely essential, nor could it be
delayed. By April the 11th the Germans were approaching the
Forest of Nieppe. Passchendaele and Poelcappelle now protruded,
an incredible salient, that made the old Ypres Salient
unremarkable by comparison. Nevertheless, a few nights'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
respite was allowed, in order that the enemy might be
deprived of the booty, and of the shelter for future operations,
that had otherwise fallen to him. The heavy artillery
was to move back first, bringing back all the ammunition
that could possibly be carried, and tipping that which could
not into shell-holes. An extensive programme of demolitions
was planned by the C.R.E. Every dug-out or "pill-box"
of importance was to be destroyed by explosives at
the last possible moment. Craters were to be blown at
important road-junctions. Light railways were to be, as far
as possible, torn up or otherwise demolished.</p>

<p>There was a feverish rush by the Engineers, assisted by
Infantry working-parties, to do the work in the scanty time
available. Most of the forward demolitions were carried out
by the 122nd Field Company, now commanded by Major
W. Smyth, who had greatly distinguished himself during
the March retreat as an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i> to the Divisional Staff.
They were very effective. The 121st Field Company
dammed the Steenebeek in an attempt to make it a more
formidable obstacle, and began the construction of a new
line behind it. The 150th Field Company prepared ten
bridges over the Ypres Canal for demolition. The world
knows that none of these bridges was ever "sent up,"
but may not know by how little their destruction was
averted.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th of April the withdrawal of
the heavy artillery to cover the Battle Zone began, being
completed three days later. The field artillery also moved
back, leaving, however, forward guns in action by night,
to deceive the enemy as to the British intentions. All was
now prepared in rear. It remained only to withdraw the
two battalions manning the outpost positions, firing the
charges for the demolitions as they retired. This was
carried out on the night of the 15th. Necessary as was the
task, it was one which could not but inspire disappointment
and regret. In a night the British Army was abandoning
ground which had been profusely watered with its blood,
and had taken long months in winning. The enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
advanced very slowly and cautiously on the morrow, heavily
shelling Poelcappelle, now a mile and a half from the outposts,
before he ventured to occupy it.</p>

<p>The Belgian Army was extending its front, as a helping
hand in time of adversity. On the night of April the 18th
the 4th Belgian Division relieved the 30th Division, on the
left of the 36th, taking over the front of one battalion of the
107th Brigade. The next week passed quietly, the infantry
showing aggression against the enemy outposts, capturing six
prisoners in patrol affairs on successive nights. Divisional
Headquarters were withdrawn from the Canal Bank to
Border Camp, in the woodlands north of the Vlamertinghe-Poperinghe
Road. For a couple of days the Steenebeek
became the line of resistance, with outposts on the east
bank. But Kemmel, so many miles in rear, had fallen, and
the Germans were attacking north of it. General Plumer
felt himself compelled to order a further withdrawal. The
Ypres Canal was now to be the line of resistance. That
decision, it is believed, has never been realized by people
in England. Battered Ypres, small as was its actual importance
of late, had been all through the war a sort of lodestar
to the Germans. The best blood of England had been
spilt in its defence. And now, theoretically, it was in the front
line. Theoretically only, however, it may happily be recorded.
An outpost line over two thousand yards east of it was maintained,
and, as the German troops on the immediate front remained
unaggressive&mdash;they had had a heavy defeat from the
Belgians further north a few days previously&mdash;and the Lys
Battle died down, lines in rear were gradually improved and
dispositions altered, so that they might be held in greater
strength in the event of an attack.</p>

<p>The second withdrawal of the 36th Division was evidently
anticipated by the Germans, who followed it closely.
An officer and two men of the 31st Landwehr Division,
over impetuous, were captured. One party of the enemy,
pressing swiftly on, entered Juliet Farm, a point which the
107th Brigade had been ordered to retain. Both the "pill-box"
and Canopus Trench, in its neighbourhood, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
retaken next night, together with an enemy machine-gun.
The 109th Brigade on the right took five prisoners.</p>

<p>On the following day a great attack was launched by the
Germans from south of Meteren to Voormezeele, upon the
French D.A.N.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the Second British Army. Everywhere
it was completely and bloodily repulsed. To the
enemy it was a terrible check. April the 29th, 1918, deserves
to rank as high as the following 8th of August<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in
the history of the war. It marked the failure of the German
northward offensive. For failure that offensive was, as the
Somme offensive was not. The tenacity of troops on the
flanks, such as the 55th Division on the right and the 9th on
the left, had confined and narrowed the thrust. The curious
formation of great hills, in almost straight line across the
Flanders plain; Kemmel, the Scherpenberg, Mont Rouge,
Mont Vidaigne, Mont Noir, Mont Kokereele, Mont des
Cats, then, after a gap, Cassel, proved an impassable barrier
in later stages of the battle. The first of the series alone
fell. Upon the rest French artillery was now massed, pouring
death into the Germans below. A few days earlier
Ludendorff had, at a critical moment, struck again at Amiens.
That offensive, which might have changed the whole
position, had been pushed back before counter-attacks,
and nipped in bud by the brilliant recapture of Villers-Bretonneux
by the Australian Corps. The Germans were to
make new offensives and gain much ground, notably near
Rheims, where they cut the main Eastern Railway, and came
all too close to Paris at Château-Thierry. But they were
the blows of desperation. Week by week drew nearer the
great retribution.</p>

<p>The next six weeks passed quietly for the 36th Division.
The chief diversion was about a little dug-out near
Juliet Farm, in the front line, formerly a Signals testing-point
for overhead wires. Here there was constant bombing
and raiding, largely to the disadvantage of the German
troops, who were not of first quality and were unable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>withstand our men in close fighting. During the month of
May fourteen prisoners were taken by the Division on
seven separate occasions. One night a German wagon with
rations drove into our outpost position in error and was
captured, so indeterminate were the opposing front lines.
The 36th Divisional Artillery had returned and taken over
the defence of the front before the end of April. Early in
May it received, with all other British divisional artilleries
in France, a proportion of Indian personnel for its D.A.C., to
replace English drivers. These were thereupon sent back
for training as gunners.</p>

<p>During this period there occurred a great change in the
command of the Division. Within three weeks three general
officers long associated with it returned to England. On
May the 6th Major-General O. S. Nugent, C.B., D.S.O.,
was succeeded by Major-General Clifford Coffin, V.C.,
D.S.O., in the command of the Division, General Nugent
proceeding next day to England, preparatory to taking up
a command in India. As long as the 36th Division is remembered,
General Nugent's name will be associated with
it. His whole existence was centred upon it; he was
intensely proud of its achievements and jealous for its good
name. It owed much to him, particularly to his training
in the early days after its arrival in France. His successor,
General Coffin, was an officer of the Royal Engineers, with
a reputation for vigour, and a Victoria Cross gained for
great bravery at Ypres. Just before General Nugent,
General Withycombe and, just after him, General Griffith
gave up command of the 107th and 108th Brigades respectively.
General Withycombe had commanded his Brigade
from within a few days of its arrival in France, except for
a short period in 1917 when he had commanded a Brigade in
England, and had inspired affection and trust in all its ranks.
His headquarters was always a happy family, and a hospitable
one, as the present writer would be ingrate were he
to refrain from recording. The war leaves few pleasanter
memories than those of meals at friendly boards after much
perambulating of trenches. General Griffith had arrived a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>little later, and his service with the Division was actually
longer. His imperturbability and resource in moments of
emergency had often served it and his own Brigade well.
Their successors were Brigadier-General E. J. de S. Thorpe,
D.S.O., in the 107th Brigade, and Brigadier-General E.
Vaughan, D.S.O., in the 108th.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Major-General C. C. Coffin, V.C., C.B., D.S.O.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The 36th Division had indeed enjoyed the continuity of
tradition and purpose which comes from a long tenour
of command by senior officers. General Nugent, General
Withycombe, General Griffith, General Brock, in the Divisional
Artillery, had now commanded for two and a half
years. In the 109th Brigade had been more frequent
changes, but two of its Brigadiers, Generals Ricardo and
Hessey, who between them commanded it for two years,
had previously commanded two of its battalions.</p>

<p>In the early days of June came a most welcome relief,
just when the country was at its best. Handing over the
defence of the line to the 12th Belgian Division, the 36th
moved back to the agreeable wooded area between Poperinghe
and Proven. It was now in II. Corps reserve, ready
if necessary to support the right flank of the Belgian Army.
One Brigade, two Field Companies, and two companies of
the Pioneer battalion, were at the disposal of the II. Corps
for work on rear defences. There was now, men said,
"wire from Ypres to Calais." Between Ypres and Poperinghe,
six miles apart, were no less than four well-defended
lines: the Brielen defences, and the Green, Yellow, and
Blue Lines. In rear of Poperinghe were plenty more. The
troops working upon these defences were relieved periodically,
the other formations and units carrying out training.
The Artillery put one section per battery into positions
prepared for the defence of the Blue Line, in the event of
another great attack, which still appeared not improbable.</p>

<p>The troops benefited very greatly from this welcome
respite, the first the Division had had for a year, if the few
days in the snow at Christmas be excepted. The young
soldiers who now for the most part filled the ranks grew
strong under the influence of good food, exercise, and life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in the open under pleasant conditions. Their fitness for
battle increased swiftly under that of steady training. There
was plenty of sport, football, cricket, running, and boxing,
in all of which their neighbours, the Belgians, took a hand.
The only trouble was the extraordinary epidemic of influenza
which swept over the world that summer, and
visited all the armies in the field. Some German divisions,
it was reported, were for a time not in a fit state to
move or fight owing to its ravages. In the prevalent fine
weather, fortunately, men recovered quickly from its effects.</p>

<p>The 36th Division had great tasks yet before it. It had
to swing its hammer in the mighty line of destroyers that
was to crush in the German defences and open the road to
final victory. For those tasks that sunny month of June
out of line was, as a prelude, of inestimable worth. After
the dazing and deadening effect, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abrutissement</i> of a battle,
nothing told so much on the dash and energy of troops as
long, dreary months of trench warfare, even in a line relatively
quiet. They lost not only their physical agility, their
power to march and run, but their mental power as well.
A spell such as this gave them not only new strength, but
new heart, new spirit, new hope. Affairs might be gloomy,
but gloom was dispersed by the sun, like the Flanders mists.
When the Division next entered the line, it was once again
a fine fighting force.</p>

<p>That event came in the first week of July. The French,
who, after losing Kemmel, had made a very fine stand
at Locre, the vital gateway to the valley between the Scherpenberg
and Mont Rouge, were now being relieved by the
British along the line of the hills. After three days about
Cassel, in reserve to the French XVI. Corps, the 36th Division
relieved the 41st French Division on the northern
skirts of Bailleul. Divisional Headquarters were established
at Terdeghem, with a command post on the Mont des Cats
prepared for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'emergiences'">emergencies</ins>. The sudden move had almost,
but not quite, succeeded in spoiling a very fine Divisional
Horse Show, held at Proven, in beautiful weather and surroundings,
on July the 3rd. Upon this the officers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
neighbouring Belgian Cavalry Division, including an Olympic
competitor, descended like wolves on the fold, giving a
remarkable display of skill and horsemanship, and taking
practically all the prizes for jumping events.</p>

<p>The Division was to hold this line for upwards of two
months, then to go forward upon the enemy's heels. Nor
was it ever again to be forced to give ground. The gray
blur on the horizon was brighter now; the light was not
far off.</p>

<span class="smcap">Back to the Messines Ridge: July to September 1918</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The new sector was at the north-west corner of the great
salient made by the Lys offensive. It ran from Fontainehouck,
a hamlet north-east of Meteren, which was in the
hands of the enemy, to the high ground south of the Croix
de Poperinghe. It was about a mile and a half north of
Bailleul. Here, as all along the line of hills, the enemy
was at heavy disadvantage. His territory was overlooked.
Every movement, every gun-flash, could be noted from
Mont Noir and the other hills. Bailleul crumbled away
before the eyes of our men. St. Jans Cappel, for so long
Divisional Headquarters in days that now seemed very far
away, was not far behind the front line. It was to a great
extent destroyed. Many of the isolated farms, with which
that countryside is bestrewn, were, however, undamaged,
right up to the front line. The country was deep in crops,
the wheat having to be cut round the outposts to prevent
surprise attacks and provide a field of fire. As for vegetables,
the men had all the potatoes and green peas they
could eat without walking a hundred yards from where they
slept. After Ypres, it was a very agreeable position. German
artillery fire was not as a rule severe, owing to the fact
that the battery positions were overlooked from the hills.
The worst disturbance was caused by night bombing, assiduously
practised by the enemy. Casualties were low. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
would have been lower had our troops been as circumspect
in following the hedges, and confining their movement to
the night, as their predecessors, the French, had been. But
the lesson of "lying low," so well learnt by Frenchman
and German, never had been mastered by the British soldier,
nor ever was.</p>

<p>On July the 19th the 9th Division, in line on the right,
captured Meteren, the Artillery of the 36th Division co-operating
in the attack. The 36th Division did not at first
strive to improve its position in a similar way, but contented
itself with raids on a large scale. One, by the 109th
Brigade, resulted in very heavy fighting, the enemy being
on the alert. Though the enemy's casualties were estimated
at thirty, and a prisoner was taken, the raid hardly ranked
as a success, since our casualties were seventeen, including
four men missing. The 107th Brigade, on the left, had a
more satisfactory venture. A strong patrol of the 2nd Rifles
surrounded a farm in which there was an enemy garrison
of ten. Two of these were taken prisoner, the rest killed.
The patrol had not a casualty, despite heavy machine-gun
fire. Further prisoners were taken by the 107th Brigade on
a later occasion, while the only raid attempted by the enemy,
from Haagedoorne, where his troops held the old railhead,
was beaten off by rifle fire, even though the Germans got
within twenty yards of the outposts before being seen.</p>

<p>An interesting event of this period was the visit of His
Majesty the King to the area. On August the 6th, at
Oxelaere, a little village on the slopes of Cassel Hill, he
presented to Lieutenant Knox, 150th Field Company, R.E.,
the Victoria Cross won by him during the March retreat
in circumstances that have been described. On the following
Sunday His Majesty attended a parade service at
Terdeghem, where were Divisional Headquarters.</p>

<p>The 36th Division, being in the Second Army, was not
destined to take part in the early great counter-offensives
that raised all men's spirits and showed the world that at
last the tide had turned. The first of these had been French,
though four of the best British Divisions had played their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
part in it. In what is now known as the Battle of Tardenois,
beginning on July the 18th, the salient of the great German
advance to Château-Thierry had been crushed in, and the
enemy routed, with great loss of prisoners and booty. Then,
on the 8th of August, came a second mighty blow. The
Fourth British and First French Armies began a great
offensive down the Amiens-Roye Road. The quality of the
resistance with which it was met showed that German discipline
and German steadfastness were weakening at last.
On the 21st the British Third Army, and a little later the
First Army, launched still greater attacks, sweeping swiftly
across the waste of the old Somme battlefield, and once
more approaching the Hindenburg Line. Before that was
reached the 36th Division, up in Flanders, was again in
action.</p>

<p>Various local offensives had been planned, to take from
the enemy what little good ground he held near the point
of his salient. The 9th Division's capture of Meteren has
been mentioned. At the end of July, the 1st Australian
Division, further south, had retaken Merris. On August the
18th the 9th Division carried out a further successful operation,
capturing the important Hoegenacker Ridge, south-east of
Meteren. It was now the turn of the 36th Division to
improve its position. On August the 22nd an attack carried
out by the 15th Rifles, on the right of the line, advanced it
a quarter of a mile on a front of half a mile. Twenty-two
prisoners and two machine-guns were captured. A curious
and vastly effective ruse was employed in conjunction with
this operation. The demoralising effect of the Livens projector
upon the enemy was well known, but its use, charged
with gas, would have prevented any immediate attack by
our troops upon the area bombarded. The drums were
therefore filled with a scent which resembled the smell
of gas. Many of the enemy had run back before our
men advanced, while others were caught wearing their
respirators.</p>

<p>Two days later an attack on the left by the 1st and 9th
Irish Fusiliers, under a barrage of smoke and shrapnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
advanced the line to the Haagedoorne-Dranoutre Road on a
front of upwards of a mile. So great was the surprise
and so swift the assault, that the enemy was "smothered,"
and did not make a serious resistance. Sixty prisoners and
eleven machine-guns were taken here. An enemy counter-attack
in the evening was brought to a stop by rifle and
machine-gun fire, though the 108th Brigade lost one small
post. The line was now a thousand yards only from Bailleul,
and the defences of the town were pierced. An attack
upon the salient would now have resulted in a great German
rout. The enemy did not await it. Under the skilful
leadership, that was never more apparent than in the months
of defeat and humiliation which were to follow, he flitted
in a night.</p>

<p>The 36th Division, on the morning of August the 30th,
was awaiting relief by the 35th Division, to be given a short
period of rest and training before being launched upon the
great series of final offensives in Flanders. Its right-hand
neighbour, the 9th Division, had already been relieved by
the 31st Division on the Hoegenacker Ridge, with a like
object. That rest the 36th Division was not destined to
enjoy. At ten o'clock that morning came a report from
the 31st Division that the enemy was gone from its front,
and that its men were entering Bailleul from the south.
Before two o'clock patrols of the 36th were in the huge
Asylum north of the town, and upon the Neuve Eglise
Road. The relief was cancelled and an immediate advance
ordered, to be carried out by the 109th Brigade.</p>

<p>This was not the first enemy retirement in the Western
theatre. There had been that of 1917, in which some of
the troops now in the 36th Division had been the pursuers.
No doubt the men who had then tracked the retreating
Germans had felt elation. But that had been false dawn.
Now, as men sprang up eagerly to set about their preparations,
a conviction spread among them that this was the
true, that not again would they have to turn back. Some
of our present-day pessimists pretend that by the summer
of 1918 the horror, the iron ruthlessness, of the war had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
robbed men of their stores of latent enthusiasm, and that,
even for victory, they had none to summon forth.</p>

<p>It is untrue. Were it true, they could not have so swiftly
prevailed against an enemy, disheartened indeed, but still
disciplined, tenacious and well led, still admirably equipped,
and, above all, backed by a series of defences such as
the Allies, in their days of adversity, had never dreamed of.
All testimony, moreover, is to the contrary. Like a flame
the spirit of victory, the bright-hued prospect of deliverance,
spread among all ranks. Defeat and retirement had bred
melancholy and bad temper. The new atmosphere dissipated
them. To go forward, to strike, to make an end&mdash;those
were the impulses and the hopes that swept through
the waiting ranks.</p>

<p>The ground immediately to be recovered had a double
appeal, a sentimental interest. It was that which had been
the area of the Division for a year. The Château of St.
Jans Cappel had been Divisional Headquarters for the
greater part of that period. The remains of that pleasant
villa&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heu quantum mutata!</i>&mdash;were to shelter General Coffin's
staff during the advance.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> On the Ravelsberg Ridge, the
first objective, had been the Divisional School. In Neuve
Eglise, the second, had been a Brigade Headquarters. Not
a house, not a lane, not a forlorn camp with shell-punctured
hutments, not a machine-gun position further forward in
the old battle-line, but was known to some of the officers
and men now making ready to advance. There was triumph
even, mingled with the pathos, in re-entering poor, battered
Bailleul, which had been a good friend in time past.
From a handsome town it was become a mass of ruins, so
completely destroyed that, across a fine central <em>place</em> of
several acres, there was now but a single narrow track for
transport through the rubble. By midnight on the 30th the
patrols were half a mile along the Neuve Eglise Road and
a mile from the summit of Ravelsberg Hill. To capture
that on the morrow was the task of the 109th Brigade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The Brigade had a wide frontage, roughly a thousand yards
north of the Neuve Eglise Road, and two thousand south
of it. The advance was steady, but made in the teeth of
considerable machine-gun fire. The Germans had evacuated
their positions, but they did not want to be hurried,
nor were they prepared to forego the opportunity of inflicting
loss upon our troops which such a height as the
Ravelsberg afforded. But, once that hill captured, the
enemy rearguards were hustled down the further slope.
By night the Brigade had reached the foot of the next hill,
a mile east of the Ravelsberg. A mile and a half to the
south the 1st Inniskillings had its right upon the main
Armentières Road.</p>

<p>Neuve Eglise was the first objective for September the 1st.
The 2nd Inniskillings was ordered to extend its left flank
as far as the road from that village to Dranoutre, and advance
with its left upon Wulverghem. The 108th Brigade
had meanwhile moved up in support to Haagedoorne, the
107th being in the area of Mont Noir and Mont Kokereele.
Great efforts were being made to bring artillery forward
over the very bad roads. Kemmel Hill was once again in
British hands, and good news came in the morning from the
30th Division, on the left, which had reached Lindenhoek
and south of it as far as the valley of the Douve.</p>

<p>The severest resistance was met at Westhof Farm and
De Broeken, both well known of old, where German machine-guns
caused serious loss. German artillery fire was also
heavy. The various strong points were taken one by one.
The German rearguards slipped back in each case before
our men came upon them, but a number were killed in
flight and, outside Neuve Eglise, a machine-gun and two
prisoners captured. By afternoon the enemy had been
driven back to the western outskirts of the village. Some
of the 2nd Inniskillings appear actually to have reached its
houses, but the line finally taken up at night was five hundred
yards short of it.</p>

<p>The 108th Brigade was ordered to pass through the
109th at night and resume the advance, its objectives being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
from Red Lodge, in the north-west corner of "Plug Street
Wood," to South Midland Farm on the Wulverghem-Messines
Road. The artillery was now in a position to give it adequate
support. The attack was carried out by the 12th
Rifles on the right and 1st Irish Fusiliers on the left. On
its southern flank, Kortepyp Cabaret and the Custom House
on the Steenwerck Road gave trouble.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> A Stokes mortar
here well repaid the labour of bringing it and its ammunition
forward, enabling the infantry to rush these places
after a short bombardment. Then the line pressed forward
to the Nieppe Road running south-east from Neuve Eglise.
Machine-gun fire from this village was at first galling, but,
after it had been heavily shelled by the artillery, a company
of the 12th Rifles took it in most gallant fashion, while
two other companies made progress to the south of it. By
four o'clock the line was east of Neuve Eglise.</p>

<p>The next obstacle was a fairly formidable one, an old
British system, the name of which recalled the days when
the British Army had been a very small force indeed&mdash;the
G.H.Q. Line. The Germans had put up some wire to
defend its support trench from the west. At 7-30 p.m.,
light being still good, our artillery bombarded these defences
heavily for an hour, after which the infantry advanced
to the attack. The trenches were not taken without fighting,
though, in all the circumstances, the enemy's resistance must
be reckoned feeble. Desultory encounters continued all
night, but by morning the infantry was in possession of the
G.H.Q. Line along the whole front. On the left, meanwhile,
the troops of the 30th Division had entered Wulverghem.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, as resistance stiffened, the frontage was
narrowed. A Brigade of the 29th Division had just relieved
the 31st Division troops on the right for the assault on the
very important position of Hill 63. The new objective of
the 108th Brigade was from White Gates, at the western
foot of this hill, to South Midland Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
At 9-30 a.m. the 12th Rifles and 1st Irish Fusiliers went
forward. In the early stages they had artillery support.
Thereafter, owing to constant movement and the difficulty
of ascertaining the position of the front line, the only assistance
that could be rendered by the artillery was by fire
on objectives far in rear, save for occasional opportunities
that came the way of single mobile guns. The attack resolved
itself into individual assaults upon German machine-gun
positions, which were taken in flank by Lewis guns
worked forward, and then rushed with the bayonet. Three
were thus taken, and their detachments killed or captured,
while none of the latter, which ran before the infantry came
upon them, escaped without loss from our fire. By evening
the line ran from L'Alouette, a mile east of Neuve Eglise,
to La Plus Douve Farm, a famous old battalion headquarters
of the 36th Division, south-east of Wulverghem. The whole
of this front was taken over after dark by the 9th Irish
Fusiliers, which battalion had not yet been in action.</p>

<p>The 108th Brigade's attack next morning began at 8-30
a.m. under a creeping barrage. Half an hour prior to it,
on the extreme right, the 9th Irish Fusiliers advanced about
a hundred yards toward Hill 63, to support an attack on
the hill by troops of the 29th Division. The attack was
completely successful. Hill 63 was of the greatest importance
to the enemy, and was very strongly held, as was
proved by the capture of nearly two hundred and fifty
prisoners by the men of the 29th Division. The hill being
in British hands made affairs far easier for the 108th Brigade.
The advance of the 9th Irish Fusiliers met with considerable
opposition. Gaps appeared, and there was some
loss of direction, not astonishing when it is considered that
the battalion was on a frontage of over a mile. Eventually
a company of the 1st Irish Fusiliers had to be brought up
on the right flank, on the Neuve Eglise-La Basseville Road.
Before noon all objectives were attained. On the right the
1st Irish Fusiliers had advanced beyond White Gates. On
the left, Gooseberry Farm, a mile east of the starting-line,
was in the hands of the 9th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>All had gone excellently so far. But the British were
now facing positions which the Germans desired to hold
for some time longer, for which they were prepared to
fight. An immediate local counter-attack down the Douve
valley was repulsed with the aid of artillery fire. But at
4-15 p.m., after a heavy bombardment, the enemy launched
a counter-attack from the south-west on this part of the
line. Gooseberry Farm and Stinking Farm<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> were lost, and
the line driven back five hundred yards.</p>

<p>On the following day the 36th Division actually lost
a little ground instead of gaining it. An attack carried
out at dawn by the 1st and 9th Irish Fusiliers, under a
light artillery barrage, insufficient to keep down the very
heavy machine-gun fire, was unsuccessful. A heavy hostile
counter-attack drove our troops back beyond their original
line. The 108th Brigade had now been fighting for four
days, with no shelter but that of old and dirty trenches,
in persistent rain. The men were in good spirits still, but
fatigue was beginning to tell upon them. It was decided
that the 107th Brigade should relieve them after dusk, to
continue the attack upon the morrow. The 108th Brigade
had captured thirty-five prisoners and three machine-guns.
Its casualties, however, especially during the last two days,
had been very heavy, numbering upwards of four hundred.
The 29th Division, on the right, was again being relieved
by the 31st.</p>

<p>The night of the relief was very unpleasant. The
Germans, beginning about ten o'clock, deluged all the low-lying
valleys with mustard and other gas shell. The new
advance was to be supported by the fire of two Machine-Gun
Companies, instead of the one which had been in
action hitherto. Captain Walker describes how he rode out
in the darkness to find his sections, scattered among battalions
of the 109th Brigade in reserve, and came into the
cloud at Neuve Eglise, forced to keep his eyes uncovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to find his way, but keeping the nose-clip and mouth-piece
of his respirator in position. When dawn broke he discovered
that the pool of gas lying in the basin in which
107th Brigade Headquarters were situated almost lipped
the entrance floor of the dug-out. Most fortunate it was
that the dug-out was half-way up the side of the basin.
When, later, he walked down the main road to Wulverghem,
he found the occupants of the dug-outs which bordered
it "being sick by the score." A good many casualties
were caused during the relief, but for the most part
the gas was not of the most noxious sort, and many of those
who had inhaled it were able to take part in the action of
September the 6th. It had the effect, however, of delaying
the relief. When dawn broke all the companies of the 2nd
Rifles were not in position; nor was it possible to move
them forward afterwards, owing to the forward slope on
which that position lay being in full view of the enemy.</p>

<p>The 36th Division Artillery was now prepared to put
down a really effective barrage, to advance at the rate of
a hundred yards in three minutes, then to form a protective
curtain two hundred and fifty yards in front of the objective,
till an hour and a half after Zero. This objective was the
old British front line, from the Douve on the right to the
Wulverghem-Messines Road on the left.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. the attack was launched. The companies of
the 2nd Rifles not already in position began to move up in
little columns as the bombardment opened, continuing this
method of advance as the barrage lifted. On the right,
troops of the 31st Division attacked simultaneously. Despite
heavy German artillery fire the infantry went forward
with great spirit. After heavy fighting, all objectives, except
Gabion Farm on the right, were taken. Nineteen prisoners
were captured, and many Germans killed. How strongly
the line was held was shown by the capture of eight machine-guns,
as well as a trench mortar. The troops of the 31st
Division also had reached their objectives. Early on the
morning of the 7th the advance was rounded off by the
capture of Gabion Farm, where a post was established.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy was not yet resigned to the loss of the
position. At dawn on the 8th, after an intense bombardment,
two groups advanced to recapture the advanced posts.
They were literally annihilated by machine and Lewis-gun
fire, a wounded survivor of each being captured. That
night the 30th Division took over the front to Gabion Farm,
while the 107th Brigade extended its right to Hyde Park
Corner, in "Plug Street Wood," becoming responsible for
the defence of Hill 63.</p>

<p>Comparative stagnation ensued, broken only by two
small attacks upon the 15th Rifles, which had now taken
over the line. The period was marked by one distressing
accident. General Thorpe, commanding the 107th Brigade,
had gone up with General Brock on the night of the 13th
to visit Hill 63 and the sentry-posts north of it. Moving
along "Winter Trench" he was suddenly fired at from point-blank
range by one of his own men and severely wounded
in the arm, his elbow-bone being shot away. It was a
stroke of cruel ill-fortune, which prevented General Thorpe
from leading the Brigade to final victory. He was able to
return to the command of his regiment after the war, but
with an arm well-nigh useless for life, from which he has
since suffered incessant pain. Lieutenant-Colonel R. H.
MacKenzie, C.R.E. of the Division, took over command of
the Brigade till the appointment of his successor. That
successor was General Brock, who, after bringing the Divisional
Artillery to France and commanding it in the field
for more than two and a half years, was to finish his career
with the 36th Division by leading an Infantry Brigade with
equal success. He was succeeded as C.R.A. by Brigadier-General
C. St. L. Hawkes, D.S.O. Another senior officer
of the Division lost to it a short time before was Lieutenant-Colonel
J. E. Knott, D.S.O., commanding the 2nd Inniskillings,
severely wounded by a shell which killed the
Intelligence Officer of the 109th Brigade, Lieutenant J. J.
Fox, and wounded the Brigade Major R.A., Major H. F.
Grant Suttie, D.S.O., M.C., by his side. Another calamity
was the bombing of the wagon lines of the Divisional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Train near St. Jans Cappel. Here a single bomb killed five
men, wounded nine, and killed no less than fifty valuable
horses, besides injuring about twenty more. A bomb or
big shell in crowded horse-lines was always one of the
ugliest sights of many very ugly that the war had to display.</p>

<p>On the night of September the 15th the 109th Brigade took
over the front, now slightly extended on the right toward
Ploegsteert. There was constant patrol activity in the days
that followed, but no further ground was to be gained by
those methods. The enemy was maintaining himself very
stoutly and his line bristled with machine-guns. It was
evident that only a great "full-dress" assault would retake
the Messines Ridge.</p>

<p>The tide of victory meanwhile had continued to flow
strongly on other fronts. On the 12th of September the
Third Army had crashed through the Hindenburg trenches
at Havrincourt. Three days later the Balkan offensive, so
long awaited that men had come to doubt its possibility,
had been launched, and attended with overwhelming success.
Within a few days Bulgaria was prostrate and Turkey out
of the war. It would have been poetical justice had it
fallen to the lot of the 36th Division to have a hand in the
second capture of the Messines Ridge, as the 62nd Division
had taken Havrincourt for the second time. If that
were denied it, it was only because it had a task even more
important to perform, a task the successful prosecution of
which would render to the enemy the famous ridge of no
avail. As a necessary complement to the great convergent
thrusts of British, French, and American armies further
south, a powerful offensive, mainly Anglo-Belgian, but in
which a French force also took part, had been planned in
Flanders, from Voormezeele northwards. It was to be
under the supreme command of His Majesty the King of
the Belgians, so that co-ordination between the three
nationalities should be assured. For this the 36th Division
was required. For the third time in its career, but in circumstances
vastly different to the two first, it was directed
upon Ypres. For the new battle some training had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
obtained by the 107th and 108th Brigades during the days
that the 109th held the line.</p>

<p>The movements were carried out with greatest secrecy.
All marches took place after dark, on the nights of September
the 21st and 22nd. The 107th moved thus to Wormhoudt,
north of Cassel, the 109th Brigade to Eecke, east of
that town, and the 108th to Houtquerque. The Divisional
Artillery moved straight to the neighbourhood of Ypres.
The Infantry of the Division was not to take part in the
first day's attack, and, for the preliminary barrage, the 153rd
Brigade R.F.A. was to be attached to the 9th Division, the
173rd Brigade to the 29th Division, on its right, the troops
of which were in line slightly over a mile east of the famous
ruined town.</p>

<p>After a few days of rest and training, the concentration
took place on the nights of the 26th and 27th. By the
morning of the 28th, the date of the attack, the three Brigades
were in camps between Poperinghe and Vlamertinghe.
Headquarters were at Vogeltje Château, near the better-known
Lovie Château, in the woodlands west of Poperinghe.
The Division was again in General Jacob's II. Corps, under
which it had served in April, May, and June. It was in
Corps Reserve, its mission being to hold itself in readiness
for a move forward to assist in the exploitation of any success
gained by the first-line Divisions.</p>

<p>The late operations had been heartening. Despite,
however, their difficulty and costliness, they represented, at
least till the final stages, no more than hard and steady
pressure upon a rearguard. No great number of prisoners
could be taken in such fighting, while the casualties to be
inflicted upon the enemy were comparatively small. The
Division had not yet had a hand in one of the great offensives.
All ranks knew that the attack about to open ranked
in that category, and that resistance of far more serious
quality was to be expected. For that they were prepared.
It is no exaggeration to say that they looked forward to the
coming struggle, just because they believed it would be the
last. Officers who came back from England the day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the opening of the attack, when the news that from Ypres
to the sea the whole line was advancing had been flashed
abroad, describe the returning leave-boat as being so full
of cheerful faces that it might have been taken for one homeward
bound. Some were less ambitious than others. In
one officer's diary is expressed the opinion that the Passchendaele
Ridge, if captured, would serve as a good "jumping-off"
ground for an offensive the following spring! But
for the most part, men, beholding victory upon victory, had
come to believe that the war could be ended this year.
For that speed was essential, else winter would come to
the aid of the enemy and give him time to collect himself.
That reasoning could be grasped by all, and acted upon all
as an added spur to endeavour in the days that followed.</p>

<p class="noindent">The attack of the II. Corps was to be carried out with the
29th Division on the right and the 9th on the left. The
left flank of the latter Division lay on the Zonnebeke Road
at Mill Cott. On its left was the 8th Belgian Division.
The Belgians did not desire to attack without preliminary
bombardment, and for three hours before Zero their artillery
shelled the German positions and battery areas. The
artillery on the II. Corps front fired for five minutes only
before Zero, which was at 5-30 a.m. on the 28th of September.
The preliminary attack was to be carried out
under a creeping barrage, with a large proportion of smoke-shell.
In density this was far less than the "creepers" of
1917, there being a gun to upwards of fifty yards. The
German defences, however, owing to the drain caused by
reverses elsewhere, were no longer manned in the strength
of those days, nor was the resistance likely to be of a quality
so high. The task, however, was formidable enough, the
ground being only less difficult than during the Battles of
Ypres, 1917.</p>

<p>The attack, launched in heavy rain, was a complete
success. The German infantry was left in the lurch by its
artillery, and, save at isolated points, made no serious
resistance. The attacking troops, Belgians and British, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
forward with the greatest dash and determination. The
Belgian infantry, which had not been involved in the great
reverses of the British and French, was by this time of
excellent quality, its ranks filled by young men of good
physique. Neither wire nor shell-pocked waste could check
the assault. The Frezenberg Ridge, that had resisted so
many attacks of old, was in the hands of the 9th Division
a little more than an hour after the beginning of the advance.
By night the 29th Division had Gheluvelt, with its heroic
memories of the 2nd Worcesters' charge on the 31st of October,
1914, and was astride the Menin Road a mile east of it.
The Belgians had Zonnebeke, and were in touch with the
9th Division on the Broodseinde Ridge. But it was the
9th which had most accomplished. Passing its third Brigade
through in early afternoon, it had seized the village
of Becelaere. At its greatest point the day's advance exceeded
six thousand yards. Verily were times changed in
these regions.</p>

<p>By an early hour it had been apparent that affairs were
marching swiftly, and at eleven in the morning the II.
Corps ordered the 36th Division to move forward, with its
Infantry Brigades in echelon. The 109th was ordered to
entrain first, and was carried by light railway to Potijze,
where it detrained at 3 p.m. It then received orders to
march to the neighbourhood of the Bellewaarde Lake. The
108th Brigade was moved east of Ypres at noon; the 107th
to Potijze later in the afternoon. So fast had been the
advance that the 107th Brigade's first orders were to move
no further than Vlamertinghe, but on arrival the men were
told to keep their places in the trucks, which bore them
forward another three miles before dusk. Headquarters of the
Division were established in the old dug-outs of the Ypres
Ramparts at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>The plan for the 29th of September was that one Brigade
of the 36th&mdash;the 109th&mdash;was to come into line between the
29th and 9th Divisions. The 109th Brigade was to be
supported by the 153rd Brigade R.F.A., hitherto under the
orders of the 9th Division, if its batteries could be got into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
action in time. As a matter of fact, owing to the shocking
state of the roads, they were not able to fire a shot till the
next day. The 109th Brigade was to pass through the 27th
Brigade in Becelaere, the latter Brigade then following in
rear of the assaulting Brigade of its own Division. The
objective of the 109th was Terhand, but, if this were easily
attained, the intention was to exploit the success. It was
attacking with the 2nd Inniskillings on the right, the 9th
on the left, and the 1st in support. A dawn assault would
have been desirable, but, owing to the difficulty the 109th
Brigade experienced in advancing by night across broken
country on roads so damaged and thronged, it was postponed
till 9-30 a.m. The Brigade's difficulties were increased
by heavy bombing of the approaches to the line
by enemy aircraft during the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>The rain continued all night, accompanied by great cold,
and in this blasted area there was no shelter for the troops.
By a stroke of fortune, however, the weather improved in
the morning, the sun appearing just about the hour of Zero.
The advance was at first very rapid. If the 109th had no
artillery support, it had small opposition from that arm.
Its difficulties were caused by machine-guns, singly or in
nests of from two to five, cleverly disposed in depth behind
hedges or in buildings. For hedges there were now, and,
though the ground had been heavily shelled, it was no
longer the sea of mud and shell-holes of the old Salient
battle-ground.</p>

<p>These German machine-guns were attacked with greatest
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élan</i>. Often the leading infantry put them out of action by
rifle-fire before the Lewis guns, a serious burden on such
ground, could be brought into action against them. Still,
there is no reason to doubt that the rate of advance could
have been swifter had artillery support been available. The
left battalion, the 9th Inniskillings, aided by the magnificent
rush of the 9th Division to north of it, found matters considerably
easier than did the 2nd Inniskillings on the right.
From two o'clock onwards the latter was held up by machine-gun
fire from Terhand, while the former pressed forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
north of the village. Terhand fell at last at a quarter to
four. By this time the 9th Inniskillings was on the southern
outskirts of Dadizeele, which was captured by the 9th Division
a few minutes later. Then, at six o'clock, the 9th
Inniskillings forced its way into Vijfwegen, a road-side
hamlet a mile south of Dadizeele.</p>

<p>The day's advance had been once more remarkable, but
much more so on the left of the II. Corps than on its right
flank. The 9th Division, from Becelaere to Dadizeele, had
gained well-nigh three miles of ground. From Vijfwegen,
however, the line ran almost west&mdash;that is to say, it faced
south&mdash;to Terhand, and thence to south of Becelaere, where
the 29th Division had been held up.</p>

<p>At 4 a.m. the 108th Brigade had moved off in support
to the 109th, being upon the high ground west of Becelaere
by 7 p.m. It was ordered to move forward again, pass
through the 109th at dawn, and advance with as objective
the great Menin-Roulers highway from Kezelberg northward.
The 29th Division, meanwhile, was to make a great
effort to force its way up into line on the right. "D"
Company of the Machine-Gun Battalion was attached to
the 108th Brigade, together with its own Stokes Mortar
Battery.</p>

<p>The position to be attacked had few artificial defences&mdash;the
German wired line defending Menin and Roulers was
just west of Dadizeele and Vijfwegen, and had already been
pierced&mdash;but it was naturally strong. The embankment of
the huge main road formed good protection to the enemy.
But the key to the position was a hillock half-way between
the road and Vijfwegen&mdash;Hill 41. Sixty feet above the surrounding
country, crowned with several farms and their
outbuildings, which had been strengthened with concrete,
it was at once invaluable to the enemy and an excellent
defensive position in fighting of this nature, when very little
artillery was available to shake its machine-gun detachments
prior to the infantry assault. With plenty, even of field
artillery, it would not have been a very formidable obstacle,
while a concentration of heavy artillery would have blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the defenders off its crest. But the big guns were still far
behind.</p>

<p>At 7-30 a.m. the 108th Brigade passed through the
troops of the 109th. The 9th Irish Fusiliers was on the
right, the 12th Rifles on the left, and the 1st Irish Fusiliers
in reserve, eight hundred yards behind the leading battalions.
Each had one section of machine-guns and one
Stokes mortar attached. The advance encountered considerable
machine-gun fire from Hill 41 and the Menin-Roulers
Road. Despite this, north of the hill it went forward in
splendid fashion. The men of the 12th Rifles fought their
way through the Zuidhoek Copse, and reached the Menin-Roulers
Road by 10-30 a.m. Touch being gained here
with the 9th Division, the 12th Rifles, according to
previous agreement, took over from its troops as far
north as Klephoek Cross Roads. On the right the 9th
Irish Fusiliers reached the Gheluwe-Vijfwegen Road,
and pressed on south of the latter village and past
the southern flank of Hill 41. But upon the hill
itself the German machine-gunners resisted all attacks. On
the right of the 9th Irish Fusiliers the 29th Division made
great strides, despite machine-guns distributed in depth all
along its front. Though it did not take Gheluwe, and was
unable to do so all day, its left flank reached the Gheluwe-Vijfwegen
Road in touch with the 108th Brigade.</p>

<p>At last the 9th Irish Fusiliers also reached the Menin-Roulers
Road, at Kezelberg, and attempted to work up it
and obtain touch with its comrades of the 12th Rifles, a
thousand yards further north, thus surrounding Hill 41.
One strongly held farm-house, with twelve prisoners, was
taken at 12-30, but thereafter fire from the hill prevented
any move northward.</p>

<p>The capture of Hill 41 evidently required a serious
effort. General Coffin arranged with the 9th Division that
its 50th Brigade R.F.A. should support an attack with a
barrage of smoke and high explosive. Behind this one
company of the 12th Rifles was to advance at 4 p.m.</p>

<p>The Riflemen, in face of heavy fire, went forward most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
gallantly. The German resistance was equally determined.
For every hedge there was a battle, the bayonet being frequently
used. Thirty-one prisoners were taken, and about
the same number of dead Germans counted after the attack.
The crest, however, could not be reached, a line being
established just short of it. But the strength of the German
defence had been under-estimated. The story of
Mœuvres was repeated with regard to this battalion. Before
reinforcements could move up a heavy German bombardment
came as prelude to a counter-attack, estimated at three
hundred strong. Atop the hill it was held by the fire of
Lewis guns, but, with their superiority of numbers, the
Germans pushed round on either flank, rendering the
position untenable. At six o'clock the company was compelled
to fall back. Its casualties had not been heavy
considering the fierce nature of the fighting.</p>

<p>The 107th Brigade had reached the line of Becelaere by
the morning, and had been ordered to push up a battalion
on the right of the 108th Brigade in the afternoon. The
2nd Rifles had attempted to advance upon Klythoek, on
the Menin-Roulers Road, but had been held up by heavy
machine-gun fire. Another attempt to advance was planned
for the morning of October the 1st. This time there was
more effective artillery support, two batteries of 6-inch
howitzers being able to shell Hill 41 at long range. To
attack the hill, two companies of the reserve battalion, the 1st
Rifles, were brought up. The 12th Rifles was to co-operate
on the left, and the 2nd Rifles of the 107th Brigade on the
right. The 9th Division was to endeavour to cross the
Menin-Roulers Road and capture Ledeghem, on the Menin-Roulers
Railway. The new attack was launched at 6-15 a.m.
in heavy mist. On the right the leading companies of the
2nd Rifles lost direction. The commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Bridcott, was killed while attempting to reorganise
them. On the left also the attack failed. On Hill 41,
however, the companies of the 1st Irish Fusiliers, fighting
their way desperately forward in face of heavy resistance,
reached Twigg Farm, just short of the crest, and captured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that place with twenty-two prisoners. Further they were
unable to go in face of the machine-gun fire. The fire
from the eastern slope of the hill was also causing serious
trouble to the troops of the 9th Division, now approaching
the Menin-Roulers Railway. After capturing Ledeghem the
Lowland Brigade made an attempt to turn Hill 41 from the
north, to aid the 36th Division, but was beaten off in turn
by the irrepressible machine-guns.</p>

<p>One more attempt finally to clear the obstinate hill was
made that day by the 1st Inniskilling Fusiliers of the 109th
Brigade, swinging in from the north. It was unsuccessful
in its object, but it achieved another not less important.
The Germans were about to launch a heavy counter-attack
on the exposed right flank of the 9th Division, when this
diversion checked them. The affair is thus reported in the
<cite>History of the 9th (Scottish) Division</cite>:</p>

<p>"Lieut.-Colonel Smyth saw the Germans collecting
troops for a great counter-stroke, and the K.O.S.B. were
bracing themselves for a desperate resistance at Manhattan
Farm, when the timely arrival of the 1st Inniskilling Fusiliers,
who made a most heroic attack on Hill 41 from the
north, scared the enemy and turned his efforts solely to
defence. Though the Inniskillings failed to capture the
hill, their plucky effort probably saved the K.O.S.B., and
so great was the admiration of the latter and the troops of
the Ninth Division who witnessed the attack, that the G.O.C.
at their request wrote at once to the Thirty-sixth Division
expressing the admiration and thanks of the officers and men
of the Ninth."</p>

<p>Local counter-attacks did come against Twigg Farm, to
be beaten off with loss by the company of the 1st Irish
Fusiliers which held it. That night the 109th Brigade
relieved the 108th.</p>

<p>The action of this day and of those following cannot be
understood without a brief survey of the general situation.
The British advance of the first two days, at its greatest
point, from east of Ypres to the Menin-Roulers Road, had
been eight miles. The Germans had been broken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
thrown into confusion. But the very rapidity of the Allied
advance, over such roads as those which crossed the welter
of the old Ypres Salient, had created new difficulties. It
was hard enough, as has been related, to bring guns forward.
But that was by no means the main difficulty, even where
the artillery was concerned. Batteries in an advance go forward
only. The limbers which feed them, the lorries which
feed the limbers from the train, must go forward and backward.
Therein lay the real trouble. The roads were choked.
The only tolerable among them, because, bad though they
were, the remains of the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pavé</i> held them together, were
the Menin and Zonnebeke Roads. Upon each was a solid
mass of transport, which often for hours at a time remained
immobile. A few days after the events already
recorded, wagons of the 107th Brigade took thirty-six hours
to proceed from Potijze Château to Terhand. Captain
Walker thus describes the Zonnebeke Road on the night of
the 30th of September:</p>

<p>"I had never previously realized the number and variety
of vehicles which move in support of three Divisions;
indeed, I think this road fed only the 9th and 36th Divisions.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
There were limbers by scores with rations; there
were G.S. wagons with forage for the battalion transports
forward; there were R.E. wagons, mess-carts, guns and
ammunition; there were lorries stuck in shell-holes in the
road, and the cause of most of the trouble. On every odd
bit of ground bordering the road were French cavalrymen.
The surface and the language were equally bad, and there
was mud everywhere. I had to wind my way through
these troubles for several miles. During my journey there
was practically no movement of the traffic. It had taken
'C' Company's transport fourteen hours to do the six
miles from Ypres to the Ridge, and the Company bivouacked
on the road for a night. A Gotha flew down that
road at midnight, dropping bombs at regular intervals.
I'm glad I missed that. There must have been many casualties,
for that road was a mass of animals and men. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
only one Gotha was out that night beats me. 'D' Company,
which was supposed to be with the advancing infantry,
was held up with everybody else. Major Wood, the O.C.,
was panic-stricken, having the General's orders to be in
action at a stated time and place, and, putting eight guns
on pack mules, set off across the desolation. I believe about
four guns did eventually come into action, but a couple of
mules got into shell-holes from which they could not be
extricated, and had to be despatched."</p>

<p>On the one hand, then, the Germans, now driven back
to the fringe of civilized and unbroken country, with roads
and railways behind them, were enabled to make some
hasty attempts at reorganization; on the other, the Allies,
having overrun their supplies, were yet under the necessity
of keeping up steady pressure, to prevent the enemy from
improving and settling down upon those positions. Doubtless
the enemy had expected to be driven back and eventually
to form up upon the line of the Lys, but he had been
driven back much more quickly than he had anticipated,
and was now anxious lest his troops should fall back piecemeal
upon the river, and its line be prematurely forced, as
the British line of the Somme had been forced in March.
He was therefore bringing up fresh troops, and, above all,
artillery, with the support of which a complete change had
appeared in the fighting quality of his infantry. The next
fortnight was to be marked by a constant see-saw, by desperate,
if minor, stroke and counter-stroke. Little more
ground was to be won by the Allies till they had mastered
the difficulties behind them, pushed forward adequate artillery
and ammunition for a new "full-dress" attack to provide
the initial momentum for a great new advance.</p>

<p>On October the 2nd, the day after its relief of the 108th
Brigade, the 109th experienced the strength of the enemy's
artillery and his determination. At 5 p.m. a heavy barrage
of artillery of all calibres fell upon the front line, upon
Dadizeele, and all approaches. Half an hour later the German
infantry advanced to the attack. The force of the
barrage had caused a withdrawal from some forward posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>tions.
These the enemy penetrated, but was quickly driven
out with the bayonet. By night the line was completely
restored.</p>

<p>It was during this attack that Captain G. J. Bruce,
D.S.O., M.C., Brigade Major, 109th Brigade, making his
way forward through the barrage to ascertain the position,
was killed. Captain Bruce was one of the Division's original
officers, and his total service with it now amounted to over
four years, except for a few months in 1917, when he had
been Brigade Major of the 47th Infantry Brigade, 16th
Division. His quickness and cleverness, and his wonderful
eye for country, which filled many a good professional
soldier with envy, made him a very fine example of the
"civilian" staff officer. His personal bravery was quite
proverbial among all ranks of the Division. He was one
of those rare and fortunate men who do not seem to require
a mental effort, a summoning of resolution, to face great
danger. He walked into it as naturally and as unconcernedly
as he walked into his office. By all who knew him
well George Bruce will long be remembered as a sagacious
soldier and a fine spirit.</p>

<p>The next three days passed without further attempt at
progress on the front of the 36th Division. All along the
line, indeed, the advance was held up, and preparations
were in train for an important new attack. For this it was
necessary that the troops should have some preliminary
rest. On the night of the 4th the 108th Brigade again relieved
the 109th, while the 107th was relieved by troops of
the 35th Division. On the 7th the 109th Brigade moved
back across the devastation to a camp between Ypres and
Poperinghe, where baths and clean clothes could be provided,
and training for the new battle carried out. The
107th Brigade had not such good fortune, as it was retired
as far only as Polygon Wood, and accommodated in canvas
trench shelters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile artillery had moved up in force. By October
the 7th there was in position covering the 36th Division's
frontage its own Divisional Artillery, the 113th Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Brigade, and three batteries of the 4th French Cavalry Division.
Medium trench mortars, including the 6-inch Stokes,
had also been brought forward in face of extraordinary
difficulties. The enemy's artillery was very active, and the
shelling in its intensity now recalled the days of the big
battles of trench warfare.</p>

<p>On October the 11th, after an intense artillery preparation,
in which the trench mortars took part, two platoons
of the 9th Irish Fusiliers captured Goldflake Farm, with
fourteen prisoners and three light machine-guns. This very
strong "pill-box," on the southern slope of Hill 41, had
defied all previous attempts. It did not on this occasion
remain long in our hands. At evening, after a tremendous
bombardment, the enemy launched an attack on the hill.
Not only was Goldflake Farm retaken, but from Twigg and
Mansard Farms, on the crest, our men were driven out.
An immediate counter-attack caused Twigg Farm to change
hands for the third time. Next morning before it was light
a patrol got back Mansard Farm, with another prisoner and
another machine-gun. That was the last of the local fighting.
All things were now prepared for attack upon a very different
scale.</p>

<p>The 35th Division, it has been recorded, had come into
line on the right of the 36th. At the same time the 29th,
its old right-hand neighbour, had been moved up to its
left flank, from Klephoek northward, and now separated it
from the 9th Division. The Second Army and the Belgians
were now to attack with the objective of the Lys. This
operation, if successful, would almost certainly cause the
enemy to evacuate the great industrial cities of Lille, Roubaix,
and Tourcoing.</p>

<p>The first general objective of the II. Corps was the
Courtrai-Ingelmunster Railway. Upon this the 36th Division
was directed, from the Lys on the right to the northern
skirts of the town of Heule. It had also upon its front
two other small towns, Moorseele and Gulleghem. The
three were in a straight line from west to east; Moorseele
being about two and a half miles from the present position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Gulleghem four and a half, and Heule six. The attack was
to be carried out by the 107th Brigade on the right, and
the 109th on the left. To the former was attached the
121st, and to the latter the 150th Field Company, while
each had a company of the Machine-Gun Battalion. A
section of each Field Company was in readiness to bridge
the Heulebeek if necessary. The Divisional Reserve consisted
of the 108th Brigade, the 36th Machine-Gun Battalion
(less two companies), the 16th Rifles (Pioneers), the
122nd Field Company, two platoons of VIII. Corps Cyclists,
and a company of the 104th Machine-Gun Battalion. Each
Brigade was to attack with one battalion in line, one in
support, and one in reserve. The Division's frontage was
about a thousand yards, though on the objective of the
Courtrai-Ingelmunster Railway it grew to fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>With the artillery now at the disposal of the Division,
and the considerable heavy artillery at that of the II. Corps,
the barrage was to be something like the barrage of old
days. There was, in fact, one field gun or howitzer to a
little more than twenty yards. There was to be no preliminary
bombardment. The barrage was to come down
two hundred yards in front of the forming-up line of the
infantry three minutes before Zero, and to begin to creep
forward at that hour. It was to move at a rate that would
have seemed incredible a year ago, one hundred yards in
two minutes, with a pause of fifteen minutes every fifteen
hundred yards. East of Moorseele the field artillery barrage
was to halt from Zero plus 115 minutes to Zero plus 132
minutes, then to cease. Upon this line the infantry was
to remain an hour, to allow the support battalions to
pass through the leaders, and batteries of field artillery to
move up west of the town and aid the next advance.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the morning of October the 14th the
attacking troops were formed up east of the Vijfwegen-Zuidhoek
Road, in trenches hastily dug by the Pioneers and
122nd Field Company. At the same hour the 108th Brigade
began a quiet withdrawal, leaving its outposts on Hill 41
in position. The batteries of the field artillery were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
position close up to the front line. Even then their final
barrage east of Moorseele would be at almost extreme range
for the 18-pounders.</p>

<p>At 5-32, on a morning most fortunately fine, but foggy,
the thunder of the barrage broke out all along the line.
Three minutes later it began to move forward, followed by
the infantry. The mist made the keeping of direction
difficult, and the attackers eventually fell behind the barrage.
It had served its purpose, however, in keeping down fire
from the German front-line "pill-boxes," which had been
the cause of so much trouble in the last fortnight. Behind
it the infantrymen swept in with the bayonet, and the
struggle that had so long endured was ended in a few fierce
moments.</p>

<p>East of the Menin-Roulers Railway the enemy had ample
opportunity to stop the advance, had he been the grim-fighting
German of old. But this he certainly was not,
though the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division, opposed to the
36th, was one of his best. By eight o'clock the 15th Rifles,
the leading battalion of the 107th Brigade, were upon the
outskirts of Moorseele. Their neighbours, the 1st Inniskillings,
were slightly ahead, having reached the Rolleghem-Cappelle
Road north of the village. Here they were held up
by machine-gun fire from the town, till the latter was
captured by the 15th Rifles. Then a line was swiftly consolidated
east of Moorseele, while the support battalions,
the 1st Rifles on the right and 2nd Inniskillings on the
left, made ready to pass through, and the batteries were
rushed forward into action close to the western outskirts of
the town. This operation was splendidly accomplished.
The first action of Major R. R. Sharp, D.S.O., M.C., commanding
A/173, on reaching Moorseele, now being heavily
bombarded, was to ascend the church steeple. From there
he saw a German 77-mm. battery doing great damage.
Fire opened by his battery, under his observation, killed
the detachment and horses of this battery and blew up its
ammunition, dumped beside the guns. The latter were
captured in the subsequent advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>All had gone excellently so far. Casualties had been
light, and strong positions had been taken with surprising
ease. Prisoners numbered over a hundred and fifty, while
ten field guns and five horses had also been taken. As for
light machine-guns, with which the whole German front
had bristled, they were now tossed in heaps, too large to
be counted for the time being. It was a fine achievement
to have accomplished between half-past five and ten o'clock.
But it was the beginning only of the day's work.</p>

<p>At 10-35 the advance was resumed, in weather still
misty. Once more all went well. There had been no
trouble with the Heulebeek, the bridges across which had
not been destroyed by the enemy. For over a mile the
two battalions went forward almost unchecked, driving in
or capturing the machine-gun groups that disputed their
passage. Then, a thousand yards west of Gulleghem, came
resistance more severe. The machine-gun fire had greatly
increased, and the town was defended by three lines of
wire. Attempts were made to outflank the town from north
and south. They were partially successful, some of the wire
being negotiated, but not all. By midnight a line three
hundred yards west of Gulleghem was being consolidated,
and arrangements were in train for an attack at nine the
following day with a fresh barrage. On the right the troops
of the 36th Division were in touch with those of the 35th
Division; on the left with those of the 29th, held up in
front of the village of Salines. To the north the attack
had been equally successful, and the whole line ran almost
due north and south, the Belgians, who had fought magnificently,
having their heads slightly in front. It had been
a splendid day's work; for the Allies one of the great days
of the war. With casualties comparatively light, they had
driven back the enemy four miles upon a wide front,
capturing ten thousand prisoners and over a hundred
guns.</p>

<p>The barrage for the 15th, in view of the events of the
preceding day, was slowed down slightly, to a hundred
yards in three minutes. East of Gulleghem there was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
be a halt of three-quarters of an hour, to allow the third
battalion of each Brigade to pass through and advance upon
Heule.</p>

<p>With the first onrush resistance was swept aside. Twenty
minutes after Zero the 1st Rifles was across the Gulleghem-Wevelghem
Road. A few minutes later the 2nd Inniskillings
had the whole of Gulleghem in its area, save a few "pockets"
of machine-guns which could be cleared at leisure. On the
left the 87th Brigade took Salines about the same time.
The 1st Rifles, destined to pass through its sister battalion
on the front of the 107th Brigade, did not move up quite
swiftly enough, and, as a consequence, lost the barrage.
The 9th Inniskillings, on the left, with the advantage of a
good main road in its area, pushed ahead north of the Heulebeek.
By two o'clock its troops were through Heule, and
upon the objective of the Courtrai-Ingelmunster Railway,
east of the town. It had advanced a mile and a half in two
and a half hours.</p>

<p>The 1st Rifles, meanwhile, without artillery support, had
been brought to a halt by machine-gun fire from farms and
hedges. A new barrage was arranged, to commence at
4 p.m. Under its cover the 1st Rifles quickly overran the
enemy machine-guns. By 7 p.m. the battalion was on the
railway embankment, in touch with the 9th Inniskillings.
On the left the 29th Division had likewise reached the
railway, while further north the 9th Division and the Belgians,
who had made one of the greatest advances of a day
in face of opposition, were miles east of it, in possession
of Cuerne and Bavichove. The left flank of the 35th Division,
on the other hand, was a thousand yards in rear of
the right of the 107th Brigade.</p>

<p>The original intention had been to pass the troops of the
108th Brigade, the head of which was on Moorseele at
the time the morning's attack was launched, through those of
the other Brigades that afternoon, to advance upon the Lys
at Courtrai. The slight delay above recorded caused a
change in this arrangement. The 108th Brigade was now
ordered to pass through at dawn on the 16th, and establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
itself upon the Lys. During the night the 107th Brigade
was ordered to send out a patrol to discover whether the
Germans were going to make a stand west of the great
canalized river.</p>

<p>By a curious coincidence there happened to be in the
2nd Rifles an officer, Lieutenant F. Adams, who was a
native of the city of Courtrai. He was naturally chosen
to make the reconnaissance, but his intimate knowledge of
Courtrai may not have been altogether an advantage, for
he made an investigation so thorough that he was not back
till the following morning, when the barrage for the advance
of the 108th Brigade had commenced. He had discovered
that the Germans had evacuated all the quarter of the city
north-west of the river, and blown up the five bridges which
spanned the latter. When this news, and also the information
that the troops of the 29th Division were on the
Lys, north of the city, was received, the barrage was instantly
stopped and the 12th Rifles, with no other protection
than that of advanced and flank guards, marched down the
road from Heule into Courtrai.</p>

<p>There were scenes of great enthusiasm among the citizens,
who came forth into the streets from their cellars to
greet the troops. But the Germans were not far off. As
the first British troops appeared on the quays of the Lys,
here eighty feet wide, heavy machine-gun fire burst out all
along the opposite bank. Anything more difficult than to
force a crossing, in the heart of a city full of friendly
civilians, to whom and to whose property it was desired to
do as little damage as might be, against German troops of
the old mettle, could not well be imagined. But the Germans
opposite were not of the old mettle, and General
Vaughan decided to attempt to throw a bridge across in
broad daylight. The 122nd Field Company with its pontoons
had moved forward in readiness.</p>

<p>At 2 p.m. a smoke-screen was put down. Five minutes
later, under its cover, the first boat-load was across. The
men leapt ashore exultingly and drove the Germans from
the bank. They had had scarce a casualty. Another boat-load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
followed, and in an incredibly short time the bridge was
practicable for infantry. But the German artillery soon had
its range. The men of the 122nd Field Company, who displayed
the greatest gallantry, suffered heavy loss, and eventually
the bridge was destroyed. The party on the other
shore, however, held its ground without difficulty. The
machine-gunners of "C" Company, attached to the Brigade,
distinguished themselves particularly in this day's
operations.</p>

<p>The obvious course now was to await darkness, throw
another bridge across, clear the city of Germans, and be
ready to advance eastward at peep of day. But news arrived
meanwhile which altered these plans. The Allies were not
going to batter Courtrai. They were going to force the Lys
to northward, swing half-right, and drive down upon the
Scheldt, or Escaut, as this portion of the river is called by
French-speaking people, thus turning all the great industrial
towns. As a fact, the evacuation of Lille, the western-most,
was proceeding at this very moment. The 36th
Division was required for the new thrust, and was to be
relieved at once by the 123rd Brigade of the 41st Division.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, as the bridgehead&mdash;without a
bridge&mdash;was useless to the relieving Brigade, the bridgehead
party was quietly and skilfully withdrawn at dusk and
ferried across, together with six captured Germans. The
relief was complete by eight o'clock, and the 108th Brigade
marched back through new-won Heule and Gulleghem, to
the village of Drei Masten, north of the latter town. The
other Brigades had begun to move back earlier in the afternoon.</p>

<p>If the troops had been cheerful before, they were jubilant
now. They knew themselves infinitely better men than
the enemy, who, still supported by huge masses of artillery
and by machine-gun fire which General Jacob later described
as "the heaviest ever experienced in this war,"
never awaited their onslaught long. It was evident to all
now that the war would be over by Christmas. A little
longer and the German Army would be beaten to its knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The worst danger, the greatest obstacle to the launching
of the death-thrust, was now, in fact, behind, not in front.
It lay in those terrible roads of the devastated area far
behind, with which the troops, now upon the untouched
soil of the richest agricultural land in Europe, might feel
they had no connection, but across which every mouthful
of food they ate and every bullet they fired had to come.
The strain upon the mechanism of the lorries was tremendous,
and they were constantly breaking down. The
strain upon their drivers was no less, and at this period
they were less easy to replace than their wagons. The
loss of horses, too, from bombing, in the Artillery and the
Supply Services, had been very serious and could not be
replaced at the moment. To add to the difficulties of communication,
rations had to be brought up for the Belgian
civilians, many of whom had been left stripped bare and
in danger of starvation by the Germans, who took horses,
carts, cattle, fowls, and all stores they could lay hand upon,
in their retreat. In the hardest work they were ever called
on to perform, the A.S.C., both mechanical and horsed
services, scored a triumph. The success they achieved was
due in part to good organization and industry. But it was
due, above all, to the grit and determination of the junior
officers and drivers in the performance of their tasks. The
lorry-driver, who stuck for fifteen hours at his wheel amid
the ruts and turmoil of the Menin Road, as many of them
did, with bombs crashing down at night; the section of
the Divisional Train bringing up its wagons through
valleys wreathed and stinking with gas, these men in truth
deserved well of the infantrymen facing the bullets further
forward, and were in truth their companions-in-arms.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Advance to Final Victory (II):<br />
October 18th to November 11th, 1918</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">In the forcing of the Lys the 36th Division was to have
the honour of the "left of the line," a real honour, because
in an attack only a good Division was employed on the
flank of an Allied Army. The reputation of the 9th Division,
which had hitherto occupied that position, is too high
to stand in need of glorification. But the 36th Division
was not only to move on the flank of the British Army; it
was to be its left flank-guard across the Lys, which was to
be crossed by it first of any British Division, and considerably
before its Allies on the left.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 18th of October General Coffin's
headquarters were established in Lendelede, a town of
upwards of four thousand inhabitants. Here the Germans
had left behind perhaps the most valuable gift they could
at this juncture have bestowed&mdash;excellent baths, where
three hundred men could be bathed within an hour. Accommodation
generally was now very good in a country
so thickly populated, but there were still some unpleasant
surprises. One such was the discovery by one unit, that
in an excellent stable, recommended to it by a civilian,
there was in each of ten stalls a dead horse, killed a week
earlier by a single burst of Belgian shrapnel. That evening
the relief of the 3rd Belgian Division, along the left bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of the Lys, from Bavichove to the point of junction between
the river and the Canal de Roulers à la Lys, was carried
out by the 109th Brigade. Heavy bombing of the roads
by enemy aeroplanes made it an affair of great difficulty.
A French Division, the 164th, was coming in on the left
of the 36th, but there was no prospect of its being ready
to cross till the night of the 20th. As every moment was
of importance, the 36th Division had orders to effect a
passage more than twenty-four hours earlier.</p>

<p>General Coffin's scheme was in itself a scathing commentary
upon the decadence of German moral. It was
one which would not have been contemplated in the heroic
age of the German infantry. In those days an isolated
battalion, pushed across to form a bridgehead, would have
been flung back into the river almost before it had had
time to draw breath. But times had changed, and methods
changed with them. Extreme boldness now paid as it had
never paid in the previous course of the war. With adequate
artillery support great risks could be taken, for the German
machine-gunners frequently left their positions under heavy
shell-fire. Moreover, there were no more "pill-boxes."</p>

<p>The Germans, it must be explained, appeared to be
holding the opposite bank of the Lys in some strength.
At several points they had put up wire fences to defend it.
Opposite Oyghem, near the 36th Division's left flank, was
one very large moated farm, round which they had dug
a trench. The plan was that one battalion of the 109th
Brigade should be ferried across at dusk on the 19th, should
push forward to the main Courtrai-Ghent Road, from east
of Beveren to Dries, on a front of a thousand yards. That
accomplished, a second battalion was to cross, to form flank
from the Oyghem-Desselghem Road to the left of the
leading battalion. Two machine-gun companies were allotted
to the operation, "B" to fire a barrage, "C" with its
sections attached to the battalions of the 109th Brigade.
The original intention had been for the 121st and 150th
Field Companies to effect crossings for the infantry opposite
both Oyghem and Beveren. A daring daylight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
reconnaissance of the river-bank by Lieutenant W. Brunyate,
of the latter company, caused the Oyghem crossing to be
abandoned, and the construction of a bridge at that point
postponed till the first part of the programme was complete.
The bank here was very steep, was heavily wired,
and commanded by machine-guns. The farm of which
mention has been made would have been in itself a formidable
obstacle. Three bridging wagons with full bridging
equipment had been brought up the previous night and
hidden in farm buildings beside the river bank, north-west
of Beveren, by the 121st Field Company. The pontoons
of the 150th Field Company were hidden slightly further
north.</p>

<p>At dusk two pontoons were launched, and at 7-25 p.m.
the passage of the 9th Inniskillings began. Two trips were
actually made before the enemy fired a shot; then machine-gun
fire burst out, followed a little later by that of artillery.
Nevertheless, by 8 p.m. the whole battalion and its attached
section of machine-guns<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> were across, with one casualty only.
Hastily in the darkness the battalion formed up. Then the
British barrage dropped, and it began its advance over open
country. The night was cloud-veiled, but the full moon
was of great assistance to subsequent operations. Capturing
such machine-gun detachments as did not fly, the 9th Inniskillings
worked its way steadily forward, and crossed the
Beveren-Dries Road, four hundred yards short of its objective,
the main road from Courtrai to Ghent. Almost immediately
afterwards, however, it was held up by heavy machine-gun
fire. It had not accomplished quite all that had been
hoped, but it had done enough. The still more complicated
task of bringing across a second battalion to guard the left
flank remained.</p>

<p>Directly the 9th was over, the 121st Field Company set
about throwing across a "half-pontoon" bridge. It was
found, however, that the river was here actually over a hundred
feet wide, considerably more than was anticipated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the information in our possession, and that two pontoons
in halves would not reach across. Since pontoons were
infinitely precious&mdash;some having been sunk at Courtrai&mdash;as
many as possible being required for a subsequent heavy
bridge, an attempt was made to assemble a trestle-bridge
instead. But under the very heavy shell-fire now falling
upon the river this had to be abandoned for want of time,
and eventually a pontoon was borrowed from the 150th
Field Company to complete the bridge. It was ready at
ten o'clock, just as the leading platoon of the 1st Inniskillings
appeared on the bank. The battalion had four hours
for its crossing and assembly on the further bank.</p>

<p>On the left flank of the attack were four villages, Desselghem,
Spriete, Straete, and Dries. Of these the first was
considerable, the others tiny hamlets which were really part
of it.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Desselghem and Spriete were to be attacked by the
two leading companies; Straete and Dries by the supporting
companies, which were to pass through them. The
operation of bringing the battalion across, forming it up
and attacking north-eastward, at right angles to the line of
attack of the 9th Inniskillings, of supporting the new attack
by barrage fire, would have been considered of the greatest
difficulty in the mimic warfare of manœuvres, and would
almost certainly have been characterized as impossible by
the umpires. In this case the whole programme, owing to
good staff work, intelligent local leadership, and the dash
of the private soldier, was carried through without a hitch.
Spriete and Desselghem were cleared; then the supporting
companies went through. Their task was a sterner one,
since the Germans had had time to make some preparation
for resistance. Straete was captured after fierce close fighting,
the Inniskillings frequently using the bayonet. On the
right the other company reached the outskirts of Dries, but
was unable to make further headway, and there consolidated
its position. Here again, though not quite all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
won, elbow-room sufficient had been gained. Eighty prisoners
had been taken, and passed back over the pontoon
bridge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_284.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was now the turn of the 107th Brigade. The sappers
passed a busy and disturbed night. The shelling of the
Lys continued, and there was a direct hit on the bridge,
a pontoon being damaged and a length of the superstructure
destroyed. By desperately hard work all repairs were completed
for the leading battalion of the 107th Brigade, the
15th Rifles, to cross at 2 a.m. This battalion, followed by
the 1st, moved forward, the former forming up west of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Courtrai-Ghent Road, in relief of the 9th Inniskillings,
which withdrew through its ranks. Troops of the 9th Division
had crossed about midnight, but, as may easily be
imagined, it was not without considerable difficulty that
touch was obtained with them. This, however, was at last
accomplished, but the line at the point of junction was
perilously close to the river, owing to the fact that German
machine-gunners still held out in Beveren.</p>

<p>At 6 a.m. on the 20th the new attack began. Beveren
was quickly taken, with some aid from the Scots Fusiliers
of the 9th Division. Machine-gun fire was very heavy, and
the 15th Rifles had considerable casualties. The commanding
officer, Lieut.-Colonel B. Y. Jones, D.S.O., was
killed. But the advance continued at a great pace. The
main Courtrai-Ghent-Antwerp Railway was crossed before
eight o'clock. An hour later the line was astride the road
from Deerlyck&mdash;already in the hands of the 9th Division&mdash;to
Waereghem. A mill on that road gave considerable
trouble, but was eventually taken by a platoon of the 1st
Rifles. Further progress for the time being was found impossible.
The advance had reached a point two and a half
miles from the Lys, and could no longer be supported by
artillery fire. At 12-30 p.m. the 1st Inniskillings made
another attempt to clear Dries, and reached the centre of
the hamlet. Resistance was now quite determined, and it
was decided to await the crossing of the French before
attempting any move on the left flank. About two hundred
prisoners had been captured in the day's operations.</p>

<p>The Engineers had continued their good work. By
evening a pontoon bridge for first-line transport had been
thrown across by the 150th Field Company. The 121st had
completed a good permanent foot-bridge, and, returning to
the abandoned trestle, for which all materials had been
collected locally, had finished that also. At night the 108th
Brigade and a French regiment on the left made the crossing.
Artillery, however, could not cross yet awhile. The 108th
Brigade was to relieve the 109th, and the advance was to
be continued for another twenty-four hours without it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The advance of the 21st was timed for 7-30 a.m. It
was to be carried out by the 1st Rifles of the 107th Brigade,
and the 1st Irish Fusiliers of the 108th. It was, however,
important to be rid of the hornet's nest in Dries upon the
flank, and this village was cleared by a company of the
12th Rifles before the attack began. Without artillery this
attack was of the greatest difficulty. There were no hedges,
and it was the custom in this part of the country to lop
the lower branches off the trees. Consequently, the attacking
force was constantly exposed to long-range machine-gun
fire. Moreover, the 133rd French Regiment, since it
had to fight its way from the river bank, was always in rear.
In all the circumstances the advance of the day, which
found the right of the 107th Brigade at Knock, north of
Vichte, and the left of the 108th at Spitael, on the Ghent
Railway, was highly creditable to the troops concerned.
The advance of the 107th Brigade, with the 9th Division
on its right, was to be resumed on the morrow, but it was
decided that the 108th Brigade should not move till the
French had come up into line.</p>

<p>By the morning of the 22nd the Lys was crossed by
bridge after bridge in the area of the 36th Division; there
being, besides numerous foot-bridges, three medium bridges
for first-line transport, and a trestle which was subsequently
used by French motor-lorries. On the night of the 21st
the four batteries of the 153rd Brigade R.F.A. crossed the
river, to fire a barrage in support of the 107th Brigade next
day. On the right, upwards of half the distance between
the parallel rivers, the Lys and the Escaut, had now been
covered. From the Gaverbeek onwards the advance was
now faced by rising ground, which culminated in a general
ridge before the drop down, over some two miles, to the
valley of the latter river. The various little crests of this
chain afforded excellent positions to the enemy, and it was
evident that, if so disposed, he could make a very effective
stand before falling back across the Escaut. The first of
them had to be attacked on this morning. It was taken by
the 2nd Rifles. The barrage, small though it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
been reckoned in old days, and as it was in comparison
with the German barrage which had to be faced, nevertheless
made a wonderful difference to the attack. The little
rise, about a mile north-east of Vichte and topped by a
windmill, was carried. But there followed the most resolute
counter-attack experienced for a long time by the 36th Division.
It was made by a Prussian Assault Battalion, and
succeeded in driving our men off the crest and back for
almost eight hundred yards. Colonel Becher, commanding
the 2nd Rifles, organized a new attack by two companies,
which, going forward with the greatest gallantry, once more
drove the Germans off the crest and re-established the
position. The left flank swung sharply back, the junction
with the 108th Brigade being on the Deerlyck-Waereghem
Road. On the left of the 108th Brigade the French, after
heavy fighting, were established in Spitael.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, as the enemy appeared to be withdrawing,
the advance was continued all along the line behind a screen
of scouts. A squadron of French dragoons, attached to the
Division, made a spirited dash for the Escaut crossing at
Berchen, but came under heavy machine-gun fire from the
second line of hills, which it was evident the enemy held
in force. He had, in fact, withdrawn a mile or so during
the previous night. On the extreme left a company of the
1st Irish Fusiliers, entering Heirweg, was vigorously counter-attacked
and driven out with the loss of several prisoners.
Eventually a liaison post was established by British and
French at the station, just west of the hamlet. On the
right the 1st Rifles had captured Vossenhoek and Hutteghem.
The advance had been well maintained. The men of the
107th Brigade were now, however, weary, and the battalions
very weak. It was decided to relieve the Brigade that night
by the 109th. This was carried out without event.</p>

<p>The following day was given to reorganization. Two
batteries of the 173rd Brigade had crossed the river on the
22nd, the remainder were now brought over in readiness to
support an attack upon the ridge. This took place at 9 a.m.
on the 25th. The 109th Brigade on the right had two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
battalions, the 1st and 2nd Inniskillings, in line; the 108th
one only, the 12th Rifles. The advance was covered by a
barrage moving at the rate of a hundred yards in three
minutes. On the right not much progress was made, in
face of heavy machine-gun fire. Loss of direction, due to
fog and the smoke-screen of the enemy barrage, caused considerable
difficulty. Eventually a line east of Hutsbosch was
consolidated. On the left the 12th Rifles made an advance
of half a mile, in face of the most determined opposition
encountered since the fighting at Hill 41. Every house was
held, and the Germans fought their machine-guns desperately.
No less than ten were counted in ten separate
houses at the day's end. The advance would have been
greater had the French supported it on the left, but their
line had not moved beyond Heirweg. The work of the
12th Rifles on this day was probably the best performed
by that battalion, amid much good work accomplished since
the beginning of offensive operations. Repeatedly the men
had charged in upon houses defended by machine-guns,
and bayoneted the detachments.</p>

<p>The 9th Division had captured the twin crests of Ingoyghem
and Ooteghem, and it was determined that the 109th
Brigade should, the same afternoon, assault that of Kleineberg,
to their north-east, which would have brought the
right of the Division, its left drawn back through circumstances
beyond its control, into the van of the advance.
A new barrage, starting at 5 p.m., was hastily planned and
admirably carried out. Unfortunately, however, orders did
not reach the battalions soon enough, and, at the appointed
hour, three companies only, two of the 1st Inniskillings and
one of the 2nd, went forward to the attack. And it must
be remembered that companies were now never more than
fifty strong. The crest was actually reached, but the advance
had been on a frontage so narrow that it was impossible
to maintain the position. A farm-house at the foot
of the slope was, however, held and consolidated.</p>

<p>The 26th was a day of calm, broken when night fell by
tremendous shelling, above all with gas, which seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
almost to have superseded high explosive and shrapnel in
the enemy's armoury. Nor was a further advance contemplated
on the 27th, owing to the complete exhaustion of
the troops. A wounded prisoner had, however, reported
that it was the enemy's intention to withdraw at once to
the Escaut, and our outposts were on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i> for signs
of such a movement. About 2 p.m. that afternoon they
were rewarded. Small bodies of the enemy were seen retiring
from the Kleineberg Ridge. Instantly patrols of the
109th Brigade were pushed forward and occupied it. And
so this last goal of the 36th Division, after three years'
campaigning, was reached without a shot fired. The 108th
Brigade, in attempting to follow suit, met with a certain
resistance, but the 9th Irish Fusiliers had the railway "halt"
west of Anseghem before dusk. Attempts were made to
push onward to the river, but it was found that the Germans
still held Bergstraat with machine-guns, and no further
progress could be made. It was quite evident that they were
not going to fall back on the Escaut till forced to do so.
Their policy, directed with great skill&mdash;for never did the
work of their divisional and regimental commanders shine
more brightly than in these days&mdash;was to give up what
could not be held, and no more, thus husbanding till the
last the declining moral of their infantrymen, and delaying
the advance as long as might be. A resistance more rigid,
with the German soldier in his present temper, would inevitably
have led to a break through, somewhere or other,
and a consequent rout.</p>

<p>The bolt of the 36th Division was now shot. Weary
flesh was at last proclaiming itself master over spirit unwearied.
The only thing that had kept the men so long
on their legs in this winter warfare was the excellence of
the accommodation behind the line. Such a campaign in
devastated country would have been unthinkable. Even as
it was, they had been subjected to great hardship and exposure,
while the constant gas shelling had had some effect
on many hundreds who had not left the ranks. The casualties
since the beginning of offensive operations numbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
over three thousand. Of these, six-sevenths were wounded,
and a very large proportion, most fortunately, suffering
from light wounds from machine-gun bullets, or a temporarily
disabling whiff of gas. But not more than a tenth
of these casualties, or of a certain sick wastage, had been
replaced by reinforcements. As a consequence battalions in
action had seldom more than two hundred or two hundred
and fifty bayonets. Other arms had suffered in less, but
still in high proportion, while the loss of transport animals
was becoming serious. All preparations were made for a
renewal of the attack, but on the afternoon of the 27th
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber Note&mdash;Original text: 'cane a wire'">came a wire</ins> from the X. Corps to the effect that the Division
would be relieved by the 34th, and would come under
its orders the following day, being withdrawn for rest and
reorganization. Soon after dusk on the 27th the 101st Brigade
of the 34th Division relieved the two weak Brigades
of the 36th in the line, which began their march back to the
area about Courtrai. Though little they knew it, their
part in the war was finished.</p>

<p>The Artillery and Medium Trench Mortar Batteries had
further work to perform, when the 34th Division, having
pushed up to the banks of the Escaut, forced its crossing
in the first week of November. The 107th, 108th, and
109th Light Trench Mortar Batteries were also lent to the
34th Division on that occasion. The distinction of having
fired the last shot of any unit of the 36th Division is claimed
by both artillerymen and Stokes gunners of the 108th Light
Trench Mortar Battery, in action after the other two had
expended all their ammunition. Let both divide the crown.
No other unit would begrudge it to either.</p>

<p>In the late operations the 36th Division had inscribed,
on these its final pages, one of the brightest chapters of
its career. It had been a period marked by a brilliant
co-operation of every arm, combatant and non-combatant.
Amid many great achievements, perhaps the most satisfactory
of all had been that of the Engineers. For once
their work, always so hard, but generally so obscure and
thankless, had stood out in the foreground. Upon it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
hinged the whole attack across the Lys. They had carried
out, with supreme skill, devotion, and success, what is perhaps
the sapper's first task in warfare, of which he is
popularly supposed to dream, that of putting the infantry
across a great river, to be launched to victory from the
further bank. General Jacob's message, a few days before
the Division was finally withdrawn, is the best testimonial
to what the troops and their leaders had accomplished.
It ran as follows:</p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">
"Major-General <span class="smcap">C. Coffin</span>, V.C., D.S.O.,<br />
Commanding 36th Division.<br />
</p>

<p>"The 36th (Ulster) Division has been fighting continuously
since the 28th September in the operations in
Flanders. The spirit, dash, and initiative shown by all
ranks have been splendid, and beyond all praise. The
leadership displayed by yourself and your Brigade and other
Commanders could not have been bettered. The conditions
under which the men have had to fight have been, and are still,
very trying, but nothing seems to stop your gallant Division.</p>

<p>"I have also been much struck with the good staff work
of the Division, and it is very creditable to all concerned.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly express to the Commanders, Staffs,
and all ranks of the Division my heartiest congratulations
and thanks for their work.</p>

<p>"When the history is written of what the Division has
done in Flanders during the past month, it will prove to
be a record of magnificent fighting and wonderful progress;
for, during this period, an advance has been made of about
twenty-five miles over the worst of country, and under the
heaviest machine-gun fire ever experienced in this war.
This advance has entailed constant fighting, but the 36th
Division has overcome every obstacle, and has proved itself
one of the best fighting Divisions in the Army, well commanded
and well staffed.</p>

<p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>On November the 2nd, Divisional Headquarters and the
107th Brigade moved to Mouscron, practically a suburb of
Tourcoing, but on the other side of the frontier, in Belgium.
Training and reorganization were carried out. Ranks filled
up, and the troops, in splendid billets, speedily threw off
their fatigue. Another turn in the line was still expected.
But that was not required. If the 36th Division was not
actually "in at the death," it had afterwards the satisfaction
of knowing that the war was really won when it left the
firing-line. The very day after, October the 28th, the German
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> was signed by the "Chief of the General Staff
of the Field Army"&mdash;Hindenburg&mdash;instead of the "First
Quarter-Master General"&mdash;Ludendorff. The meaning of
that was instantly grasped. Ludendorff, the great gambler,
whose final throws had brought him so near success, had
resigned. A day later, and it was announced that Austria
had thrown up the sponge. On the 7th of November the
German <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parlementaires</i> passed through the French lines at
Guise, on their way to interview Marshal Foch. Then
came the news of the Armistice.</p>

<p>It was celebrated by the troops in France without that
wild hilarity, wild almost to hysteria, that greeted it in
London. Perhaps the man who had been trudging forward,
week by week, facing the machine-guns, if in front, sniffing
for gas, and, by night, listening anxiously for the purr of
the Gotha, if in rear, hardly realized that it was all over.
The men were, none the less, intensely happy. Everywhere
they were <em>fêted</em> and acclaimed by the civilians whom
they had freed from four long years of bondage. Best of
all, after years of discomfort and exposure, they slept softly,
undisturbed by the crash of bombs.</p>

<p>And so, as Lord Fisher afterwards put it, "at the
eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month,"
the war came to its end.</p>

<p>This History contains few of those Special Orders of
the Day which, long after the events that gave them birth,
are inclined to appear heavy, and sometimes fail to accord
with present sentiment. That of General Jacob has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
quoted because it was under his fine leadership that the
men of the 36th Division marched to final victory. It
would not be fitting to conclude this chapter without recalling
that issued at the end of hostilities to all the Allied
Armies by the Marshal in supreme command, who inherits
from his teacher, the greatest soldier his country and the
modern world ever produced, the gift of making a few
words majestic and ever-memorable. Amidst our present
discontents some of the glory of these words of Marshal
Foch may appear tarnished, but, like the words of Napoleon
to his troops in Egypt, they will endure, when immediate
sorrows and disappointments are forgotten, perhaps when
the very causes for which men laid down their lives by
millions have become obscure.</p>

<span class="smcap">The End: November 1918 to June 1919</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">But little remains to be told. The war was over, and men
were eager to be home. There was a certain disappointment
that the Division was not to form part of the British
garrison on the Rhine. As a fact, one Division only of
the New Armies was chosen for this duty. It was the 9th,
with which, since April, in days of reverse and days of
victory, the 36th had been in comradeship as close as any
two Divisions can have known in the course of the war.
None begrudged to it this seal upon its splendid record.
And, apart from a momentary regret at missing the sight
of that apotheosis of victory so long awaited, officers and
men speedily recognised that their lot, during the remaining
days of their incorporation, was fallen in fairer ground.
The end of the 36th Division's existence, amid a friendly
and a grateful populace, was far happier than it would
have been amid the restrictions and comically correct civilities
of Cologne and the Bridgehead.</p>

<p>Soon after the Armistice the 36th Division settled down
for the winter astride the Franco-Belgian frontier. Headquarters,
the 107th and 108th Infantry Brigades, the 121st
and 122nd Field Companies R.E., and the 16th Rifles
(Pioneers) were one side, at Mouscron. The Artillery, in
Tourcoing, the 109th Brigade and 150th Field Company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
at Roncq, were the other. The Pioneers had the hardest
work, being employed on railway reconstruction and upon
the Escaut bridges. Some military training, mainly ceremonial,
was carried out. But chief energies were devoted
to recreation and to the education scheme, which attempted
to provide for the young soldiers some preparation for the
civil life to which they would shortly be returning. The
idea was a worthy one, and was organized with skill and
enthusiasm, yet it is to be doubted whether a large proportion
had much benefit of it. By the time it was really
in full swing, demobilization was at the same stage. The
majority of the men attended but a few classes before they
returned, and can have acquired but a smattering of the
subjects they were pursuing. December was the most successful
month, when there were recorded 54,203 attendances
at the various classes. On the lighter side there were competitions
in Rugby and Association football, cross-country
running, boxing, and rifle-shooting. Christmas, the fifth
since the Division's formation, its fourth since crossing the
Channel, was happily celebrated. The Divisional Canteen
had on this occasion its greatest triumph. The position
was difficult. Behind lay the area of the Ypres battlefields;
around, the country had been practically denuded of food-stuffs
by the Germans. The Canteen Officer had, in the
first place, made arrangements with a farmer near Dunkirk
to attend markets in that region, buy up poultry, and feed
them on her farm till it was time to kill them for Christmas.
Had a British officer done the buying, the prices would
have been prohibitive. It was soon found that the good
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermière's</i> estate would not hold all the birds required, and
a further order was placed with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Halles</i> in Paris, through
a Dunkirk merchant. Pigs were also bought, to be killed
on the appointed day. But difficulties grew with demands.
Lorries broke down in the swamps about Ypres. The
Canteen Officer began to wonder whether his head upon
a charger would not be the chief dish of the occasion. On
Christmas Eve the Paris consignment arrived at Dunkirk,
but it was in the middle of a line of trucks which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
not be disentangled, and would not have been for days.
Finally, after some shunting, a lorry was got alongside.
When the lorry arrived at Mouscron it was found to contain
also a large case of eggs, a luxury unknown for months,
a special order for some unit in Dunkirk. Naturally it
was then impossible to send it back. Every man in the
Division had plentiful fare, while, adds the Canteen Officer
modestly, "no other division in the district got anything
better than bully beef." The present writer can bear witness
that the turkeys ordered for divisions on the Rhine
arrived in many cases long after Christmas, and frequently
had to be buried forthwith by special parties.</p>

<p>In the combatant ranks, alas! there were few who had
spent the first Christmas with the Division.</p>

<p>The following day there was the great ball given by
the ladies of Ghent to the British Army, which was attended
by fifty officers of the 36th Division. At the end of January,
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on his return from Germany,
paid the Division a visit of two days. This visit was informal
and marked by no parades, but the Prince, despite
very bad weather, visited a number of units, and had long
conversations with officers and men on their experiences.</p>

<p>January was also the month when the flood of demobilization
rose to its height. In its course over four thousand
officers and men were sent home. In the following month
came orders for one battalion to be sent to Germany for
service. The 12th Royal Irish Rifles was chosen, and made
up to strength from volunteers of the 1st, 2nd, and 15th
battalions of that regiment. On March the 2nd it entrained
at Mouscron, where the whole Division, less the Artillery,
was now concentrated, and proceeded to join the 2nd (now
the Light) Division on the Rhine. Soon afterwards the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cadres</i> of the regular battalions began to move home. On
March the 12th the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief
paid a farewell visit to the Division. When he laid down
those duties that he had so splendidly and courageously
performed, it was indeed clear that the era of the Great War
was at an end. A few days later General Coffin, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
whose vigorous leadership the 36th Division had achieved
its final triumphs, left it to command a Brigade in the
British Army of the Rhine. Divisional Headquarters were
reduced to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cadre</i>, the new commander being Brigadier-General
P. Leveson-Gower.</p>

<p>The last words were not written till June. Then the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cadres</i> of the remaining service battalions proceeded to the
Base, and Headquarters formally closed. In January the
36th Division had practically ceased to exist. Now, six
months later, its name departed from official registers.</p>

<p>Its History would not be complete without some reference
to the Ulster Divisional Fund. This Fund owed its
inception to General Nugent's forethought. The 36th
Division was certainly the only one to look forward to the
period after the war as early as 1915. Before quitting the
Division in 1918, General Nugent executed a Trust Deed
in favour of Lord Dunleath and Sir Robert Kennedy,
establishing a Trust for the benefit of officers and men of
the Division, their wives, widows, children, orphans, or
dependants. Roughly speaking, a sum of £18,750 has been
administered by the Administration Committee, to whom
the Trustees delegated the management of the Fund. Of
this over £14,000 was derived from divisional undertakings,
including the canteens, the concert party, the cinema, etc.,
and over £2,000 from dividends and interest. It must be
remembered that the sums derived from divisional undertakings
represent a proportion only of their actual profits.
Large sums were expended in France, on sports outfits,
on Christmas fare, on free buffets at horse shows and other
entertainments, and on the still more important buffets for
"walking wounded" during the progress of a battle. The
Fund was opened to applications for relief in February
1919. It has now been practically all distributed in grants
to relieve and assist men of the Division, and has been
without doubt of very great value. The total number of
grants made exceeds two thousand five hundred.</p>

<p>The record of the 36th Division is high and honourable.
The names of the actions in which it fought, given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
according to the official report of the "Battles Nomenclature

</table>

<p>These names are given because, unfamiliar as they may
sound to many of the men who fought in the actions, they
are their official titles. It will be seen that from the first
time the Division fought a big battle there is one considerable
gap only, between the Battle of Albert, 1916, and the
Battle of Messines, 1917. That gap is partly to be explained,
no doubt, by the fact that the Division, after its
great losses on the Somme, was never really up to strength
till the spring of 1917. The cause of that, again, is not
far to seek. The stream of recruits from the voluntary
system was drying up by 1916 all over the country, and
from the Military Service Act of that year Ireland was
excepted. The people of Ulster had certainly no cause for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
shame with regard to its response during the voluntary
period. Belfast claims to stand second on the roll of British
cities for numbers of recruits in proportion to population,
up to the imposition of universal service. But,
after Messines, a large number of English reinforcements
arrived, while, in late 1917 and 1918, as has been recorded,
five regular battalions of Ulster regiments joined the Division.
Of the offensive battles, it was engaged in two defeats,
but in one of these it was completely victorious upon
its own front, being compelled to withdraw because of
failure elsewhere. The 36th Division, then, failed once
only in attack, in the Battle of Langemarck. And, on that
day, in the circumstances wherein the troops found themselves,
it may be doubted whether success was within mortal
compass. In defensive fighting it proved itself equally devoted,
possessed above all of a hidden spring of fortitude
which enabled it, as we say of a gallant horse, to "come
again" when apparently at its last breath from exhaustion.</p>

<p>In bright days and dark there can be no doubt but that
much of its success sprang from the mutual confidence and
affection which existed between all arms. If we can employ
a word so inhuman as machine to describe a corporation
of men that was intensely alive, that had a soul of its
own, we may say that it was a machine that worked smoothly
because it was weak in none of its parts. And we must
not forget, as men are prone to forget, that, if some parts
bore a weight heavier than others, each was of equal importance
in the working of the machine. This record has
been mainly concerned with the fighting arms and, of these,
to by far the greatest extent with the infantry. For that
no apology is made. It is as just as it is inevitable. It
is not only upon the infantry that all hinges; it is mainly
by a record of the infantry's movements that the story of
battles is told. Not alone the other fighting arms, Artillery,
Engineers, Signals, Pioneers, Machine-Gunners, but Medical
and Supply Services also were animated by the same
high spirit of devotion. Of the two last comparatively little
has been said, and perhaps least of all of the Supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Services. That is a compliment rather than the reverse.
Happy, says Montesquieu, is the people whose annals are
humdrum. The saying may be applied to Supply Services
in war. The Royal Army Service Corps of the 36th Division
has few remarkable dates or occurrences in its record, but
that record is one long chain of which the alternating links
are steady work, forethought, and resource. The other
service of supply, the Ordnance, was always at a peculiarly
high standard, the Division being most fortunate in possessing
a very efficient D.A.D.O.S. in Captain Mackenzie,
over a long period. Staff Officers might come and might
go, but "Dados" went on for ever.</p>

<p>There may be required some explanation of why, in this
narrative, the series of victories in 1918 is compressed in
detail by comparison with such actions as Messines and
Cambrai. One reason is that the records of the latter are
far more complete. Another is that final victory was won
not only by the men who went forward so gallantly to
achieve it, but by all their silent comrades whose graves
lay behind them, who had fought a far more bitter battle.</p>

<p>These took the blows of the enemy upon their breasts,
but, ere they fell, the blows delivered by their arms had
enfeebled him, so that those who came after could strike
home. Like Mr. Valiant-for-truth, they might have proclaimed
with their last breath: "My sword I give to him
that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage
and skill to him that can get it. My marks and scars I
carry with me." For them, as for him, we may humbly
believe that, when they passed over, all the trumpets sounded
on the other side.</p>

<p>The 36th (Ulster) Division is but a memory to-day.
This book, of the imperfections of which as he writes its
concluding lines the author is but too acutely aware, represents
in some sort an official tribute, an attempt to put
into words the silent tribute borne by many thousands of
hearts. That tribute is paid not alone to victors in the
flesh, but to those other victors who had put it off before
they themselves knew what part they had in victory. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
we commemorate that great corporation of men which was
the 36th (Ulster) Division, our minds should embrace the
whole company of dead and living, for they are of one
brotherhood.</p>

<p>The worth of that brotherhood it is hoped these chapters
have not wholly failed to commemorate. But the power
of better pens than that of this writer were inadequate to
express, to those who have not looked upon a battle of
modern war, to the younger generation, which we pray may
not see one, what strength there must be in the fibres of
the will if they are not to snap beneath its strain. Leadership,
training, discipline, the pride which springs from the
individual's association with and amalgamation in a great
combatant formation, have their part in the toughening of
those human cords. Of themselves they do not suffice.
To engender that which was brought forth in the exploits
of the Ulster Division, they must mate with a racial spirit
possessing already in amplitude the seeds of endurance and
of valour.</p>

<p>As no similar official list is available, the compilation of the following
entailed considerable research, knowledge, and patience. Before printing,
copies of the list were submitted to representatives of units for corrections
and additions.</p>

<p>[Officers and other ranks (except in the case of those awarded the
Victoria Cross) have opposite their names their regiments or corps only;
not the numbers of battalions or other units. It was impossible to insert
these numbers in every case, and so it was thought best to do so in none.
In the case of the infantry, many officers and other ranks served in several
battalions of the same regiment at different periods.</p>

<p>Officers of the Regular Army, Territorial Army, or Special Reserve,
who served on staffs of formations of the Division, are entered under their
regiments. Those who commanded infantry brigades are entered as
"Cmndg. &mdash;&mdash; Brigade," without the names of their regiments. Those
who served with infantry battalions are entered under the regiments to
which those battalions belonged: for example, Lieut.-Col. C. F. Meares,
an officer of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, who commanded the 16th Royal
Irish Rifles (Pioneers), is entered under the latter regiment.</p>

<p>All names beginning with "M'," a form very frequent in the North
of Ireland, are included under "Mc," as it was in this form they generally
appeared in "Part II. Orders" in the field, and subsequently in the
<cite>London Gazette</cite>.]</p>

<p class="negidt2">Captain ERIC NORMAN FRANKLAND BELL, 9th Batt. Royal
Inniskilling Fusiliers.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery at Thiepval, on 1st July,
1916. He was in command of a trench mortar battery, and advanced
with the infantry to the attack. When our front line was
hung up by enfilading machine-gun fire, Captain Bell crept forward
and shot the machine-gunner. Later, on no less than three occasions,
when our bombing parties, which were clearing the enemy's trenches,
were unable to advance, he went forward alone and threw trench
mortar bombs among the enemy. When he had no more bombs
available, he stood on the parapet, under intense fire, and used
a rifle with great coolness and effect on the enemy advancing to
counter-attack. Finally he was killed rallying and reorganizing
infantry parties which had lost their officers. All this was outside
the scope of his normal duties with his battery. He gave his life
in his supreme devotion to duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Lieutenant GEOFFREY ST. GEORGE SHILLINGTON CATHER, 9th
Batt. Royal Irish Fusiliers.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery near Hamel, France, on 1st
July, 1916. From 7 p.m. till midnight he searched "No Man's
Land," and brought in three wounded men. Next morning, at
8 a.m., he continued his search, brought in another wounded man,
and gave water to others, arranging for their rescue later. Finally,
at 10-30 a.m., he took out water to another man, and was proceeding
further on when he was himself killed. All this was carried
out in full view of the enemy, and under direct machine-gun fire
and intermittent artillery fire. He set a splendid example of
courage and self-sacrifice.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Second-Lieutenant JAMES SAMUEL EMERSON, 9th Batt. Royal
Inniskilling Fusiliers.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For repeated acts of most conspicuous bravery north of
La Vacquerie, on 6th December, 1917. He led the company
in an attack, and cleared four hundred yards of trench. Though
wounded, when the enemy attacked in superior numbers, he sprang
out of the trench with eight men and met the attack in the open,
killing many and taking six prisoners. For three hours after
this, all other officers having been casualties, he remained with
his company, refusing to go to the dressing station, and repeatedly
repelled bombing attacks. Later, when the enemy again attacked
in superior numbers, he led his men to repel the attack, and was
mortally wounded. His heroism, when worn out and exhausted
from loss of blood, inspired his men to hold out, though almost
surrounded, till reinforcements arrived and dislodged the enemy.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Private NORMAN HARVEY, 1st Batt. Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty near
Ingoyghem, on the 25th October, 1918, when his battalion was
held up and suffered many casualties from enemy machine-guns.
On his own initiative he rushed forward and engaged the enemy
single-handed, disposing of twenty enemy and capturing two guns.
Later, when his company was checked by another enemy strong-point,
he again rushed forward alone and put the enemy to flight.
Subsequently, after dark, he voluntarily carried out, single-handed,
an important reconnaissance, and gained valuable information.
Private Harvey throughout the day displayed the greatest valour,
and his several actions enabled the line to advance, saved many
casualties, and inspired all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Second-Lieutenant CECIL LEONARD KNOX, R.E.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty.
Twelve bridges were entrusted to this officer for demolition, and
all of them were successfully destroyed. In the case of one steel-girder
bridge, the destruction of which he personally supervised,
the time-fuse failed to act. Without hesitation, Second-Lieutenant
Knox ran to the bridge, under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire,
and, when the enemy were actually upon the bridge, he tore away
the time-fuse and lit the instantaneous-fuse, to do which he had
to get under the bridge. This was an act of the highest devotion
to duty, entailing the gravest risks, which, as a practical civil
engineer, he fully realized.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Private WILLIAM FREDERICK M'FADZEAN, 14th Batt. Royal
Irish Rifles.</p>


<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery near Thiepval Wood, on
1st July, 1916. While in a concentration trench and opening a
box of bombs for distribution prior to an attack, the box slipped
down into the trench, which was crowded with men, and two
of the safety-pins fell out. Private M'Fadzean, instantly realizing
the danger to his comrades, with heroic courage threw himself
on the top of the bombs. The bombs exploded, blowing him to
pieces, but only one other man was injured. He well knew his
danger, being himself a bomber, but without a moment's hesitation
he gave his life for his comrades.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Lance-Corporal ERNEST SEAMAN, 2nd Batt. Royal Inniskilling
Fusiliers.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty. When
the right flank of his company was held up by a nest of enemy
machine-guns, he, with great courage and initiative, rushed forward
under heavy fire with his Lewis gun, and engaged the position
single-handed, capturing two machine-guns and twelve prisoners,
and killing one officer and two men. Later in the day he again
rushed another enemy machine-gun position, capturing the gun
under heavy fire. He was killed immediately after. His courage
and dash were beyond all praise, and it was entirely due to the
very gallant conduct of Lance-Corporal Seaman that his company
was enabled to rush forward to its objective and capture many
prisoners.</p>

<p class="negidt2">Private ROBERT QUIGG, 12th Batt. Royal Irish Rifles.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery at Hamel, France, on 1st
July, 1916. He advanced to the assault with his platoon three
times. Early next morning, hearing a rumour that his platoon
officer was lying out wounded, he went out seven times to look
for him, under heavy shell and machine-gun fire, each time bringing
back a wounded man. The last man he dragged in on a waterproof
sheet from within a few yards of the enemy's wire. He
was seven hours engaged in this most gallant work, and finally
was so exhausted that he had to give it up.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="negidt2">Second-Lieutenant EDMUND DE WIND, 15th Batt. Royal Irish Rifles.</p>

<p class="pad2x">For most conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice on 21st
March, 1918, at the Racecourse Redoubt, near Grugies. For seven
hours he held this important post, and, though twice wounded
and practically single-handed, he maintained his position till
another section could be got to his help. On two occasions, with
two N.C.O.'s only, he got out on top, under heavy machine-gun
and rifle fire, and cleared the enemy out of the trench, killing
many. He continued to repel attack after attack until he was
mortally wounded and collapsed. His valour, self-sacrifice, and
example were of the highest order.</p>
